## Designer’s tools and solutions

> We’re not addicted to devices, we’re addicted to the information that flows through them. I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information from the outside world.[^114]

Agreeing with Tea Uglow, a designer at Google’s Creative Park in Sydney, on this particular point is as easy as yearning for the utopian vision presented in her talk, “An Internet without screens might look like this” [^115]. The surfaces of this concept are dominated by wood, rocks and other natural materials, while containing all the ‘magic’ of technology–the equivalent of comparing the current environment of workplaces and homes to a vacation spot. However, in the unlikely case that, starting tomorrow, well-informed consumers or forward-thinking companies solely demand technological solutions with no significant drawbacks on our cognitive capacities, the day after tomorrow would not immediately morph into the ‘happy place’ of our daydreaming.

How could the design process change in order to deliver information without distraction or interruption? Even when all external circumstances align, it is not obvious how to figure in attention during the design process; not just the concepts and norms for treating the topic of attention, but existing practices or agreed upon interfaces and solutions are missing, which, in Pamela Pavliscak’s opinion, is precisely what is called for: “in design, we need really thorough, small, concrete steps to follow, and we rely on best practices and conventions”.

Uglow also presented a few interesting and lovable projects, including one in collaboration with the (now closed) BERG studio, that do realize her vision; still, these designs had a specific context: a group of users, like mental health patients, or a specific occasion, like a large event.[^116] Analyzing the merits and limits of other connected products of BERG, e.g. Little Printer (the most famous of them), or other projects sadly exceeds the limits of this research.

From the group designers interviewed for this thesis, relying on trial and error to come up with an original or even poetic solution (backed up by ethnographic observation) is also the preferred approach of Geoffrey Dorne; the classic production flow of wireframes, visual designs and user testing stays the same for all success metric or requirement. However, the freedom and time required for such a process is generally not available to most designers–as one should suspect after reading the previous sections–which does not mean that using qualitative research and creating new design patterns or even interfaces is the privilege of freelancers or independent researcher / designers.

Starting small, let’s see how a designer can experiment in modest ways, e.g. to come up with a more inclusive, ‘holistic’ way of tracking attention that conveys more than time spent, number of visitors or bounce rate, as moving forward probably won’t mean relinquishing attention measures in a business context. In this process, previous attempts to numerically express an emotion or quality could be an inspiration.

A specific example of using an emotive value as a success factor for Jérémie Fontana was trying to measure trust for legal or finance projects, where clients had to upload sensitive documents. These occasions are nevertheless rare, so neither he or Darja Gartner could claim having an identifiable formalized process for these cases (though the agency where Gartner works has a quite strict design flow). The classic design research tools (e.g. user journey, persona, empathy map) can facilitate a deeper understanding, but it’s hard to evaluate whether a long-term goal has been indeed achieved or not, if the agency can follow a project only for a short period and often does not have access to the client’s analytics.

For both Pamela Pavliscak and Ryan Rumsey, picking what to measure is pivotal before deciding how to measure it (and they have more freedom to do so than an average agency, for different reasons). The selection of the principles for the Positive Design Manifesto (autonomy/mastery, trust, creativity, connection/community, meaning) is an appropriate example. Pavliscak gathered the relevant academic research, including the work of Martin Seligman, a co-founder of positive psychology with Csíkszentmihályi[^117], and collected data about people’s high and low points with technology with diary studies, followed by ethnographic interviews, where some patterns emerged. One example is how creating personal meaning from the digital interactions (crafting the perfect playlist, or making a great post for social media, or coming up with a beautiful photo on Instagram) brought more joy and satisfaction than an easy and frictionless user experience.

Larger enterprises, even while demanding quick results, have the advantage of tracking metrics and iterating on a product over a long period, and their decisions are doubly important as smaller companies often follow their lead. In Rumsey’s practice, each request started with defining a successful outcome with the other team, colleague or executive coming to them. Would great design in that case equal increased revenue, or something that moves you emotionally? Depending on quantitative or qualitative aspect of the goal, the time divided between specific activities changes, but the overall design process stays the same. His team was constantly performing qualitative research with a “sense of pragmatism” during a few weeks’ time for each project in order to produce insights, even though “qualitative analysis requires more human hours.” In order to support the increase in costs (or any change in general), Rumsey had to get support from someone more senior, or gradually gain footing among the different teams; in order to achieve this, he sometimes resorted to communication tricks and quantifying whatever they were trying to improve, often with the method of the ‘perceived value scorecard’, a scale of 1 to 5 of basically anything that can’t be directly measured.

The ‘perceived value scorecard’ is merely a way to get people to listen. And the only way I can get them to listen is almost trick them instead of talking about qualitative research. ‘Well, your adoption is 2 out of 5.’ ‘What? I wanna improve that!’ ‘Well, here’s how you can do that.’

The qualitative research resulting in this score could come from diary studies, observations, interviews, which were then rolled into a single number. If their colleagues or the management wanted to get into the detailed research, it was available, but more often than not they did not mind.

For those of us who do mind what constitutes such a number, out of suspicion or curiosity about whether there is a right way to quantify trust, creativity or focus, the short answer is: no, there is no single correct method, but it is worth trying. Pamela Pavliscak also devotes quite a lot of energy to new ways of research in order to see how the criteria of the Positive Design Manifesto can be satisfied in a client project. “\[We\] experiment out loud to try to measure some of these things \[...\] and I think we’re on the right track.” At the same time, she does not think that quantifying everything is necessarily the best approach: “you can’t put a number on an emotion, or on the nature of the relationship or long-term values, \[it’s\] just kind of a stand-in or shorthand for something that you can get started with, looking at, paying attention to... I’m not sure if quantifying is ideal \[...\] for a lot of these things but it does get organizations to pay attention, and it gives a way to look at that goal.” Whereas Rumsey’s team appears to use quantification mainly as a sales strategy, Pavliscak seems to be equally motivated to gain a better understanding and tracking of emotive values.

Change Science’s experiments are made available in SoundingBox, which could be defined as a user research agency that goes beyond simple usability to compare the whole human experiences of websites, providing both qualitative and quantitative results; in a demo screenshot, effort, flow and connection were displayed with a percentage value.[^118] The process of arriving to a single number, as described in the interview, relies on “asking and tweaking questions to gather meaningful answers over simple observation” (unlike Dorne) to create a full picture: “if we’re only observing and trying to articulate the story of the people ourselves, we’re missing out on their story and how they’re making meaning and coherence.” Gathering the necessary information is inspired also by how governments are tracking healthcare, education or other aspects of well-being, which are also constantly revised.

What happens after comprehensive data about attention, trust or meaning have been gathered? Does this data directly orient us towards satisfactory interfaces, interactions or design patterns? Apart from excluding already well-documented dark patterns[^119], not really, not even for Pavliscak. The research of design solutions includes cataloging positive patterns for attention: “It’s something we all need to do.” In Pavliscak’s opinion, entirely new kinds of interaction (e.g. conversational interfaces, wearables, or the overall vision presented by Tea Uglow) are not necessarily going to ease our cognitive load by being more attentive.

Where else can we find research backed design patterns that positively impact our attentional capacities? An article by Joe Edelman, a former designer of the couchsurfing.com[^120] platform and a current collaborator of the Time Well Spent movement, suggests redesigning menus and enhancing them with circumstantial information. Menu options currently present themselves as the only possible solutions for the problem that made us open the menu the first place, when in fact it is a rather constrained and biased selection of options; it might contain the solution when the user’s needs and the creator’s intentions are actually aligned. To spot the misalignment and think of other possible activities “may require that options listings be augmented with likely time costs, likely money costs, the unlikelihood of various hoped-for outcomes, the likelihood of unhoped-for outcomes, whether there are less-costly or better-success-rate options for similar outcomes” [^121]. “In order to display these kinds of cues[^122], we’d need to build giant database about people, about their choices, and about the outcomes of those choices.” [^123] Edelman’s proposal clearly states that the database should be public, hoping for an outcome that “would reshape the media ecosystem and incentives for business.” [^124] While the creation of the database is clearly valuable, and hindering a habit could help breaking the cycle described in Hooked, complicating each interaction with more decision-making is not attentive design; it merely adds another layer of interference (which, granted, might relegate some interruptions into mere distractions). Such an overly complex interface is also very far from Uglow’s utopia of having a “happy place filled with the information we love that feels as natural and as simple as switching on a lightbulb” [^125].

Other tweaks of existing softwares, for example widgets, extensions, extra information in the browser to nudge us, block certain sites, measure and inform about the time spent, number of visits, etc. do empower the user in the present moment, but these band-aids take away time and effort from what should be the main goal: designing interfaces and interactions that do not require an added layer of protection to stay psychologically harmless. Games that promise to improve our cognitive capacities[^126] or digital detox camps are also substitutes, displacing the blame and responsibility on the users of digital product.[^127] Should we really have to run away from the technology that we ourselves created and bought?

Before giving up hope on bridging the present and the desired future of attentive design or merely waiting for the continuation of Pavliscak’s and other’s investigations and experimentations, there is (at least) one set of principles with concrete design suggestions[^128] that can be used right now for attentive design. Amber Case’s book titled Calm Technology–building on Mark Weiser’s already mentioned article, The Coming age of calm technology [^129]–presents general rules and specific examples for bringing calm design to life. The book follows up on the technological changes since the writing of the original article by updating some of the ideas and providing examples and an evaluation tool. The principles are, as follows (the parts of particular relevance for attentive design are highlighted):

I. Technology should require the smallest possible amount of attention.

II. Technology should inform and create calm.

III. Technology should make use of the periphery.

IV. Technology should amplify the best of technology and the best of humanity.

V. Technology can communicate, but doesn’t need to speak.

VI. Technology should work even when it fails.

VII. The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve  the problem.

VIII. Technology should respect social norms.[^130]

The relevance of most of these rules for attentive design is quite evident. Calm communication patterns are necessary to reach a state of deep focus or to keep technology from interrupting social situations. Although Case avoids discussing both the economic incentives to grabbing the center of attention and the entire topic of advertising, it is nevertheless a practical resource for applying attentive design as far as external interferences from technology are concerned.

So far, our research described perception as a binary concept (whether something is lit by the flashlight or not); however, dividing it into zones based on their resolution is helpful to design calm communication patterns. While Weiser only mentions the center and the periphery of attention, Case divides perception into three zones (principles I and III): primary, secondary and tertiary, and advocates using all of them appropriately. “We have high-resolution perception in front of our faces \[...\] We can, however, hear sounds, see shapes, and feel objects without having to directly look at them.” [^131] Most of the functions that we expect from a smartphone should not require our undivided attention, or not for long; calm technology can minimize these interferences (principle II). “Technology should allow us to shift our attention to it very briefly, get the information we need, and shift back, letting us attend to more things in our environment without being overwhelmed.” [^132]

Each of the three zones have their appropriate style of notifications which are not interchangeable: a tiny screen (and larger ones as well) is informative and useful only in the center of our attention, even when not all information it presents merits such a prominent place; meanwhile the secondary and tertiary zones, quite inattentively, are underused by our most common devices. “When a technology forces a low-resolution update into the high-resolution space of your full attention, it wastes your time, attention, and patience.” [^133] Primary attention is usually visual and direct, while the secondary zone’s signals do not need direct and sustained focus to be perceived, mostly consist of sound and touch; tertiary attention catches weak signs such as distant sound, light, or environmental vibration. Each medium uses a different channel, or a combination of them, e.g. the radio occupies the secondary zone, and leaves all the others free, while a screen uses the center of vision, but diminishes all the others zones, which is why a GPS-navigator using sound is much preferred to a tiny screen during driving. Or why a smart watchstrap with a tiny LED and vibration is calmer and more attentive than an Apple Watch.[^134]

Selecting which channel is relevant for a piece of information is based entirely on context and norms (principle VIII). “A trigger has a precondition, a notification state, and a post-condition. When setting up a trigger for a notification, figure out what the precondition or context for the trigger is, then determine what kind(s) of notifications work best, and finally, test your post-condition.” [^135] Whether it should be a status indicator (which can be visual, auditory or haptic), an alert or an alarm depends on many factors: is the environment quiet or filled with a lot of other signals? Is the notification time-sensitive? Can it arrive during a moment when a distraction is unfortunate or even dangerous? Senses also have their peculiar advantages and disadvantages: vision is high-resolution and it functions best in the center of attention, while auditory perception works on the periphery as well; haptic feedback is very personal and alerting, but it is almost imperceptible for others; and so on. According to Case, a designer has to evaluate all these cases and then pick a ‘just loud enough’ signal from all the options (principle V, VII): when a little beep or tone is enough, there is no need to make the kettle or the fridge talk to us. “In fact, most information that comes from devices can be presented in a calm way. This is just a matter of good design.” [^136] Or, as Tea Uglow has put it more explicitly and succinctly: “Your phone is not the Internet’s door bitch.” [^137]

In this last chapter, a wide range of options (collected from books, talks, articles and personal interviews) has been presented. If they are implemented simultaneously by designers, product managers and policymakers, they may transform the current media environment into one that structures more information for the benefit of individual and public attention and less for private economic interests.

[^134] The question whether some wearables or smart jewelries that filter notifications are useful is more uncertain. Their screenless communication patterns can reduce screen interactions on the smartphone and keep notifications in the secondary or tertiary attentional zone. However, at the same time they bring notifications directly on the body without being able to deal with them, possibly prompting the user to pull out their phone more often.
