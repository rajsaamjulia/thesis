## Information as a reward and information foraging

Most of the interferences we are subjected to are pieces of information, whether they are news, a message or the alarm of the ambulance. Although they disturb whatever we are doing at the time, they are often welcome even when not really urgent, pleasant or valuable. According to Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, acquiring information makes a specific set of neurons fire the same way as finding food or water: “\[s\]ingle dopamine neurons process both primitive and cognitive rewards, and suggest that current theories of reward-seeking must be revised to include information-seeking.” [^22] Not just the specific content but new information in itself is craved[^23], which renders moderate consumption very unlikely in an environment that provides more than what our brains can process. As the subtitle of The Distracted Mind suggests, our Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World don’t function optimally when we are faced with an overwhelming amount of information. The speed of change in our cognitive limits (if there is change at all) and in our technological evolution is mismatched.

Interestingly, the decision to engage with an external or internal distraction and turn it into an interruption can be aptly described with the help of information foraging theory[^24], which aims to explain how our need for information influences our decisions in the short-term and the design of our environments in the long term. As the original proponents of the theory explain, “the theory assumes that people, when possible, will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information.” [^25] The model is analogous to food-foraging strategies of animals, who have to find sufficient amounts of food in ‘patchy’ environments, where food is unevenly allocated in patches. The strategies developed and modified in both cases are to maximize the food or valuable information consumption while taking into account the cost of searching. An example for an animal searching for food in a ‘patchy’ environment would be a squirrel searching for nuts on trees; as the squirrel continues eating, the quantity of acorns decrease, and at a certain point it is better off searching for a new tree than continue searching on the current, increasingly empty one. Though squirrels or humans are neither fully rational nor have full knowledge of any given situation (and a piece of information does not disappear after consumption, it merely loses its sense of novelty), between these limits the model can be used to describe and predict certain behaviors and decisions.. As we spend most of our time in human-made environments, our access to information is a function of the design of these environments and our choices of interactions within these ‘patches’.

The ‘patches’ in an information environment can be books, online articles or any other media, or social communication–basically everything perceived. Some sources contain more information, others are easier to access. The estimated richness of a certain source and whether is it worth switching away to another one depends on how much time and effort would be needed to move to another source, how much valuable information is left in the current source, and how much appears to be in the next one. Another variable is the accessibility by which we measure the cost of transferring ourselves to the next source. This usually changes over the long term by designing easier access to information: book printing, public libraries, personal computers, the internet, portable computers, etc.

The model of information foraging is useful in understanding how modifying two factors (perceived richness of a source and ease of access to the next resource) can encourage more frequent switching to optimize the information consumption with strategic decision-making. If it is easier to change with two taps than to stay, or one resource is estimated to be fuller, even infinite, or more captivating, then the optimal time to switch comes sooner.

In the first part of this research, we looked at what is comprised in a somewhat simplified but hopefully nonetheless accurate theory of attention, in what ways our cognitive capacity is limited, and how interferences run up against these limits. As what we pay attention to tends to be some kind of information, we also covered the fact that our information consumption behavior can be usefully described as maximizing by following optimization strategies. The second part will examine how the limits of sustainable attention manifest in our information-rich and high-interference digital environment.
