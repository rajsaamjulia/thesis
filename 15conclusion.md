# Conclusion

Marching through psychology, economy, design and other domains to follow this research merits the reward of an extremely brief summary. Besides, there is not one individual and all-comprehensive answer to the original question of building sustainable and self-controlled attention through digital design, but several fragments and rough outlines of solutions, each of them meriting further investigation; they cannot all be listed here.

The original problem of experiencing information glut and scarcity of attention in our current media environment has been amply demonstrated by extensive research. After defining attention as the dual process of selectivity and suppression, and noting the internal conflict between high-level top-down goals and stimulus-driven bottom-up perceptions orienting our focus, we looked at how information in itself is deemed valuable and how that makes us susceptible to interferences that derail from previously set goals. Although this is a general human trait, it has never yet been exploited as efficiently as with our always present and connected digital devices. Since reductive measurements of focus are driving economic decisions, hooking attention has become an ultimate business goal, with various negative consequences. The sheer amount of interferences decrease self-control, productivity and increase emotional discomfort; they ultimately reduce the number and length of optimal experiences, resulting in a less enjoyable, satisfying or well-lived life.

In order to reduce private claims on attention and increase its individual and public control, several types of steps are to be taken. On the highest level, the options of legal solutions can set the wide framework; still, legal solutions alone won’t be sufficient. Manifestos or declaration of values give a direction without tools: a compass, not a map. Zooming in to the level of individual business decisions, the adopted behaviors and decision points start to diverge. The admirable intention to align business metrics with personal ethics are not executed the same way by everyone: the negotiations, compromises (or lack thereof) and informative activities happen at different moments of designers’ careers and in different ways. Evaluating each job, each project or each decision, by giving talks, by educating clients and interested people from all professions are all tried and proven tools for raising awareness about our current attentional predicament and creating the means for the actual design research needed to draw the map towards attentive design.

For the design process strictly understood, two areas ought to be revised: success metrics and design patterns. The methods for collecting and using data about attention (and consequently about emotions, experiences and other elusive concepts) are to be reconsidered; at the same time, interactions and interfaces in themselves and in context also have to change. The propositions range from carefully calculated and iteratively evolving metrics, small tweaks in information architecture, a coherent concept for communication patterns, to artistic and playful visions; each of them valuable, however modestly, on the road to attentive design.
