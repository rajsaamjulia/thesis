Attentive Design

How to build sustainable, self-controlled attention with digital design?

# Introduction

> What matters is not technology itself, but its relationship to us.[^1]

The place of technology in our lives is (still) changing. It feels like digital devices are designed and redesigned to get physically and mentally closer to us, and as they get smaller, they can be embedded in more spaces and situations. Though we often leave desktop computers at their own dedicated place, their pocket-sized versions come with us everywhere, and even smaller ones are starting to claim space on, and perhaps even in our bodies as wearables. However, shrinking the size of computers and normalizing their use in most life situations was a process neither instantaneous nor fully unexpected.

Mark Weiser in his seminal paper The Coming Age of Calm Technology [^2] (1996) outlined the major waves of computing, considering them as changes that fundamentally alter the place of technology in our lives. The first wave is linked to the invention of the mainframe computer from the 1940s, where many people share one computer, followed by the wave of one personal computer for each person in the 1980s. According to Weiser, the next step would take place when the internet would connect personal computers, ushering in the current wave of ubiquitous computing. Each person would use several devices. These devices also provide a constant and instantly accessible source of information (that is, when the bandwidth is wide enough and the battery is charged). Smartphones act as an ‘external brain’, keeping us constantly connected not only to information that we selected to store, but also to anything that is accessible through the World Wide  Web.

All computers and peripheral devices collect, process and provide information between themselves, their users and more recently (and problematically) to different companies offering services through them.

The observation motivating my reflection on Attentive Design is that with the overabundance of technologically mediated information available at any given moment, attention has become the new scarcity, as Herbert Simon famously pointed out decades before the appearance of the internet:

In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.[^3]

The wealth, or even glut, of information is hardly debatable, but to ascertain whether it really saturates our attention capacity, it is important to measure how much of our time and attention is actually spent interacting with different computers, especially smartphones over the last few years. According to a 2013 study by Nokia, people looked at their phones an astonishing 150 times per day on average [^4], while iPhone users in 2016 unlocked their devices 80 times per day on average [^5]. Another study measuring the difference between self-estimated and real smartphone usage on Android devices arrived to a similar number, more than double of what participants estimated about themselves.[^6] People trying to quantify other aspects of their smartphone use in the same research were similarly inaccurate. The daily active phone use added up to more than 5 hours (including when the screens were not used, like listening to music), and 55% of all uses were less than 30 seconds long.

A different approach is to measure not how often we look at but how often we touch the screens of our phones,[^7] which is more than 2600 times per day for an average user, and passes 5400 touches per day for a heavy user.[^8] It is noteworthy that when participants learned about these numbers, they did not resolve to change their habits; currently it seems tough to avoid 80 glances or 2600 touches a day. Also, being able to connect anytime and anywhere has made us expect quasi-immediate responsivity from others at all times.[^9] It is important to note that the time spent on our smartphones is not actually the total time spent with screens, since we often use several of them simultaneously. However, laptops and televisions do not permeate all areas of our lives, and are more often viewed together with other people.

The reasons we glance or pick up our smartphones vary from simple things like checking the time or turning off the alarm to reading the news, writing emails and communicate with loved (and less loved) ones throughout the day. It can inform, remind and entertain, or even help us avoid other people. After coordinating meetings, the second most reported reason to engage with smartphones was to avoid boredom[^10] (a fact which will turn out to be important later on in this research).

All in all, we look at the screen of the smartphone around 80 times a day, touch it probably more than any other object and definitely more than any other person (except maybe babies for their main caregivers). According to Tristan Harris’s popular essay How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds [^11], the reason behind such an intimate relationship with our phones is that “if, at any moment, reality gets dull or boring, our phone offers something more pleasurable, more productive and even more educational than whatever reality gives us.” However, escaping from boring moments will not necessarily amount to “time well spent” [12] or a “life well lived” ,[13] as this thesis will attempt to demonstrate. Starting with a definition of attention, we examine our relationship to incoming information and this connection’s vulnerabilities in an overwhelming media environment, and how these susceptibilities enable technological companies to design for grabbing and monetizing human attention. After analyzing how these design tools and methods affect our mind and well-being, we will conclude with a chapter about possible design solutions for protecting our attentional capabilities; the proposals–coming from books, articles, talks, other documents and in-person interviews–range from high-level ideas to concrete everyday steps.

# Information, attention and the brain

## What is attention?

In order to understand why it is so easy to be induced to spend as much time in front of screens as the above-mentioned studies indicate, even when we recognize it may be against our longer-term interest, we obviously have to look at what cognitive science tells us about how the attentional aspects of the human brain work. Humans have struggled with attention issues and cognitive control long before the appearance of Facebook, the internet or screens in general.

One of the main difficulties in talking about and measuring human attention is that it is a multi-layered concept referring to multiple processes at the same time. The theory I will use throughout this research is the one proposed by Adam Gazzaley and Dr. Larry D. Rosen in their book The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World[^14]. The most important component of attention singled out by Gazzaley and Rosen is selectivity: directing the brain’s resources on a goal, while ignoring everything else. Attending and suppressing, however, are two distinct processes, both using our limited cognitive resources. One common metaphor used to describe selectivity (and attention) is the spotlight, which sheds focused light on something while leaving everything else in relative darkness. This metaphor also enables to easily circumscribe three types of attentional limitations relating to when (expectation), where (directionality) and how long (sustainability) something remains within the scope of its light.[^15]

The expectation relative to the selection of an object depends on past events, present internal goals or external perceptions and future actions, or to put it simply, one notices what one is searching for. The direction can be internal or external: if we want to recall a memory or name, we need to ignore external stimuli as well as internal ones, e.g. hunger. Sustaining the spotlight of our attention on an object depends on the present state of our brain (fatigue, age, time of day, etc) and how engaging that object is, which in turn depends on the individual’s motivations and goals, connecting back to the aspect of expectation. Maintaining our focus for an extended period of time can become uncomfortable, and is often perceived as lingering on a boring object or situation.

To sum it up, attention is one’s available cognitive capacity divided between selecting an object to focus on and suppressing all other stimuli, and what controls the process of selection and suppression is expecting, directing and sustaining our cognitive capacity on an object.

Another important factor mentioned by Gazzaley and Rosen is our limited working memory. The function of the working memory is to hold information in our mind for a brief amount of time when a stimulus is no longer present, bridging perception and future action.[^16] To connect incoming information with our next move it is necessary to maintain a sense of continuity, and this connection can be easily disturbed as there is only so much information (7± 2 “chunks” according to Miller’s law[^17]) that one person can hold in their mind at the same time.

Last, but not least, it is important to note how setting goals is much easier than enacting them, which is where the crucial notion of interference enters the picture. Gazzaley and Rosen characterise interference as “something that hinders, obstructs, impedes, or largely derails another process” [^18]. Interferences can be internal, going on only in our minds, or external, like an alarm or a warning sign. If we decide to engage with an internal or external interference and change our course of action, it is a case of interruption. If, in spite of the interference, we continue with our action, Gazzaley and Rosen propose that we talk of an internal or external distraction, as shown on the following diagram.

If someone talks to you while you are reading this, that’s a case of external distraction. If you respond, then the other person’s comment becomes an interruption. However if you linger on a previous comment of this person while reading the next day, that is an internal distraction. If it stops you in your reading, than you have internally self-interrupted yourself.

Although in the last paragraphs, the susceptibility to interferences appears to be a flaw of our mind, it should in fact count as a vital component of the survival skills for mobile organisms. Noticing the quiet steps of a predator or the glimmering of a stream could mean life or death in prehistoric times. In the contemporary urban environment, one could say red traffic lights interfere in the task of driving to our destination in order to save the pedestrians (and the driver from prison time). On the down side, interferences disturb the process of selectivity, make it more challenging to ignore irrelevant stimuli or fill up the working memory with information which may be irrelevant. Interruptions also force the mind to engage in multitasking, which, as we will see, is merely switching between different goals and neural networks.

There are so many things that can interfere with executing even a simple task, as everyone can confirm who has been standing in their kitchen and not knowing why and how they got there. Potential interferences multiply as our goals get more complicated and distant in space and time. A general principle is that the more complex a system (our own mind, our goals or our environment), the more vulnerable it becomes to interferences. As Gazzaley and Rosen put it,

> \[t\]he conflict is between our goal-setting abilities, which are so highly evolved \[...\] and our goal-enactment abilities, which have not evolved much at all from our primitive ancestors \[..\]. It is this conflict that results in goal interference, and generates a palpable tension in our minds—a tension between what we want to do and what
we can do.[^19]

The gap of what we could do and what we actually achieve is an important illustration of the limits of our attention. In typical cases, our goal-setting is the result of a top-down internal thought process started by inserting a time delay to pause and reflect between perception and action. It is in this short timeframe that we exercise executive functions: we evaluate the situation and decide on our next action. Indeed the scale of top-down control is what mostly makes the human mind special.[^20] Goals alter not only our actions but also our perception of the world[^21], and often conflict with external, stimulus-driven bottom-up influences that prompt automatic actions. To demystify what this means, let’s take an example from our digital environment: you set the top-down goal of writing down a reminder on your phone when walking out of the office in the evening. However, there are two notifications on the lockscreen: a work email and an app’s marketing message, prompting you to take a decision: engage with them, delay them or ignore them. Let’s say you delete the marketing message, but you check the work email, which may delay the original goal (writing a reminder), or make you forget it. Or you can go on with the reminder and then check the email, or go on ignoring the email until next morning (although it may occasionally pop up in your head during the evening.) Among many other interferences, the red traffic light at the pedestrian crossing in front of the office is vital in order to not step in front of a car while executing the top-down goal of writing this reminder; still, glancing up to the traffic light slows down the original goal of typing the reminder. However, the two bottom-up perceptions of notifications on the lock screen also required immediate decision-making and maybe further engagement, and may have even distracted you from the traffic light.

Interferences in themselves are necessary to perceive and interact with our environment: other people, urban spaces or nature. Since these signals come from a given context, most of them are specific and relevant to our current situation, unlike the omnipresent smartphones and all the notifications that reach out everywhere, at all times.

## Information as a reward and information foraging

Most of the interferences we are subjected to are pieces of information, whether they are news, a message or the alarm of the ambulance. Although they disturb whatever we are doing at the time, they are often welcome even when not really urgent, pleasant or valuable. According to Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, acquiring information makes a specific set of neurons fire the same way as finding food or water: “\[s\]ingle dopamine neurons process both primitive and cognitive rewards, and suggest that current theories of reward-seeking must be revised to include information-seeking.” [^22] Not just the specific content but new information in itself is craved[^23], which renders moderate consumption very unlikely in an environment that provides more than what our brains can process. As the subtitle of The Distracted Mind suggests, our Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World don’t function optimally when we are faced with an overwhelming amount of information. The speed of change in our cognitive limits (if there is change at all) and in our technological evolution is mismatched.

Interestingly, the decision to engage with an external or internal distraction and turn it into an interruption can be aptly described with the help of information foraging theory[^24], which aims to explain how our need for information influences our decisions in the short-term and the design of our environments in the long term. As the original proponents of the theory explain, “the theory assumes that people, when possible, will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information.” [^25] The model is analogous to food-foraging strategies of animals, who have to find sufficient amounts of food in ‘patchy’ environments, where food is unevenly allocated in patches. The strategies developed and modified in both cases are to maximize the food or valuable information consumption while taking into account the cost of searching. An example for an animal searching for food in a ‘patchy’ environment would be a squirrel searching for nuts on trees; as the squirrel continues eating, the quantity of acorns decrease, and at a certain point it is better off searching for a new tree than continue searching on the current, increasingly empty one. Though squirrels or humans are neither fully rational nor have full knowledge of any given situation (and a piece of information does not disappear after consumption, it merely loses its sense of novelty), between these limits the model can be used to describe and predict certain behaviors and decisions.. As we spend most of our time in human-made environments, our access to information is a function of the design of these environments and our choices of interactions within these ‘patches’.

The ‘patches’ in an information environment can be books, online articles or any other media, or social communication–basically everything perceived. Some sources contain more information, others are easier to access. The estimated richness of a certain source and whether is it worth switching away to another one depends on how much time and effort would be needed to move to another source, how much valuable information is left in the current source, and how much appears to be in the next one. Another variable is the accessibility by which we measure the cost of transferring ourselves to the next source. This usually changes over the long term by designing easier access to information: book printing, public libraries, personal computers, the internet, portable computers, etc.

The model of information foraging is useful in understanding how modifying two factors (perceived richness of a source and ease of access to the next resource) can encourage more frequent switching to optimize the information consumption with strategic decision-making. If it is easier to change with two taps than to stay, or one resource is estimated to be fuller, even infinite, or more captivating, then the optimal time to switch comes sooner.

In the first part of this research, we looked at what is comprised in a somewhat simplified but hopefully nonetheless accurate theory of attention, in what ways our cognitive capacity is limited, and how interferences run up against these limits. As what we pay attention to tends to be some kind of information, we also covered the fact that our information consumption behavior can be usefully described as maximizing by following optimization strategies. The second part will examine how the limits of sustainable attention manifest in our information-rich and high-interference digital environment.

# Attention and economy

## The methods developed to capture attention

The fact that attention is a finite resource is not a problem in itself. Aiming to efficiently convey information has a long tradition with diverse methods, from the ancient Latin book Rhetorica ad Herennium[^26] through newspapers to Wikipedia. However, these were not designed for engagement per se, unlike what seems to be happening nowadays, when “there are literally billions of dollars being spent to figure out how to get you to look at one thing over another.” [^27] Why and how did it become so important to be noticed just for the sake of it?

The first instance of using attention as a success metric was in a paper of Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page titled The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine[^28]. Unlike Google, other search engines at the time produced “results \[that\] are often amusing and expand users’ horizons, \[but\] they are often frustrating and consume precious time.” [^29] (Note how spending time unnecessarily is yet considered a failure, not a success metric.[^30]) How the PageRank algorithm deemed a result relevant or not was, among other factors, to apply the existing model of counting the number of academic citations to a certain publication, and the importance of those publications referencing to the original one. This way PageRank could measure how much these sites were in the center of attention; the links pointing to a certain site and the number of its visitors became a success metric. However, as Brin and Page point out in the same paper, they “expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.” [^31] Google’s mission statement to “\[o\]rganize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” [^32] for everyone is contradictory to giving preferential treatment to advertisers.

Companies will say that their goal is to make the world open and connected or whatever. \[...\] But if you were to actually look at the dashboards that they’re designing, the high-level metrics they’re designing for, you probably wouldn’t see those things.[^33]

Two key factors of the attention economy that I wish to emphasize here emerged with the spread of Google Inc.: using attention in some form as a success metric, and separating users and their needs from customers and their wishes, internally prioritising the latter with high-level design metrics, while communicating the former to the public in generous marketing claims, inspiring other digital companies to do the same.[^34]

To see another important factor for the attention economy emerge, we have to jump to the appearance of social networks, when considering time spent on a site became a success metric, with a prominent place in their annual reports. Facebook competes to “provide social and communication products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online.” [^35] Or take Tencent’s goal “to engage a large pool of casual gamers and gradually advance them to mid-core and hard-core categories”, as declared in their 2016 Annual Report.[^36] As for Twitter user’s level of engagement and ad engagement, it is critical to its success,[^37] as their revenue comes from advertisers. If these explicit goals are not transparent enough, Sean Parker (president of Facebook between 2004 and 2006), acknowledged in 2017 that the company’s intention while building the product was to “consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible”,[^38] that they are “exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology” and that they also “understood this, consciously, and \[...\] did it anyway.” Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google, concurs with Parker’s assessment: “\[product designers\] play your psychological vulnerabilities (consciously and unconsciously) against you in the race to grab your attention.”

When looking for evidence of their efforts, there are plenty of examples to choose from. The bottomless feeds–used e.g. by Twitter or Facebook–present themselves as particularly rich sources of information in order to delay our transfer to the next source; they also became a content delivery standard in the industry. The reverse chronological order visible on the timestamp of each post evokes an unnecessary sense of urgency and immediacy. Notifications use similar or identical signals within an application, regardless of the importance and urgency (if at all) of the content. Some social media platforms even introduced pseudo-notifications: these can be a marketing message from the platform itself, other user’s activities or a suggestion based on accumulated data about the user[^39], all coming through the same channel where we interact with real people.

Video streaming services are also guilty in deliberately exploiting vulnerabilities of attention and self-control to increase user’s time spent in front of their content. Netflix actively encourages binge-watching its content (movies and TV series) by small design tricks, such as opting out of streaming the new video instead of actively starting it, and they are not alone: YouTube also starts autoplaying the next video on the recommendation list, unless the user actively opts out.

As we have seen in the previous part of this research, the mind comes with quite a few particular features that can be exploited: its goal-setting capabilities are stronger than its goal-enacting ones, it is susceptible to interferences, it considers information as a reward and it tries to maximize its consumption in the short term. Sending out an average of 63.5 notifications a day[^40] (for Android devices, no similar data found for iOS) is an aggressive way to draw on our craving for information in order to distract from or interrupt in whatever we are engaged in at the moment. Receiving so many external, bottom-up triggers trying to catch our attention has prompted some designers and engineers to build tools to manage all the interruptions (e.g. from the control center of the iPhone or in the application’s settings) and move from sound notifications to visual ones,[^41] similar to how ad-blockers for desktop browsers became popular to control the irrelevant commercial information.

Since external notifications turned out to be relatively manageable and avoidable, they can’t account for all the times we reach for the phone. However, internal triggers like boredom (which, as you may recall, is the second most reported reason to engage with smartphones[^42]) are much harder to neutralize. It is indeed possible to ‘design a habit’ just by following the instructions listed in Hooked[^43], Nir Eyal’s book detailing how to gain and retain users of a product and increase engagement in four steps. The cycle starts with a trigger, external in the beginning (e.g. getting a notification about a new follower), and becoming internal if the method is correctly applied (feeling a momentary pang of boredom or loneliness). This trigger prompts an action (like opening Twitter when having some time to kill), retrieving a variable reward. The small dose of surprise in what we will exactly receive prevents the product from becoming predictable and keeps holding the user’s attention again and again (e.g. browsing different content each time the user opens her News Feed). The last step closes the loop: right after the positive interaction some kind of investment (data, money, effort) is asked from the user, promising an improvement in the service for next time (e.g. following people to customize displayed content). After repeating this cycle a few times, the user most likely will develop an internal trigger thanks to the combination of the following elements: creating the mental association for the product as a relief from some kind of frustration, boredom or another uncomfortable internal state; providing a variable reward that the user will start craving; and extracting some investments from the user (time, effort, data) that ties him to this product. The mental association can partially or wholly replace the external triggers (advertisements, notifications) with the internal emotional micro-needs of the user. As Nir Eyal states, “\[t\]he habit-forming products we use are \[...\] there to provide some sort of relief.” [^44]

Undergoing the cycle of trigger, action, variable reward and investment creates a more personalized product experience each time, and strengthens a habit, slowly but surely turning new users into frequent and then compulsive users. Pondering whether this habit adds not just instant gratification or temporary relief, but substantial value to a person’s life is obviously not included in Eyal’s description. He would rather trust the conscience of designers, product managers and engineers[^45], which seems rather ironic after having described in great detail how to create habit-forming or addictive products, in principle enabling anyone, regardless of their intentions, to design a habit for others. Eyals ‘ethical guideline’, the Manipulation Matrix, includes only 2 yes-no questions: whether the product materially improves the user’s life, and whether the maker is also a user. The only case when he disapproves of using habit-forming methods if it is the case of a double ‘no’. One should note that applying this matrix would mean that all the methods of Facebook are ethical by definition, since Mark Zuckerberg has his own profile; but perhaps it is rather unrealistic to expect individuals to self-examine and then modify their behavior accordingly when faced with carefully engineered practices that promote unreflective action.

Ethical design in the attention economy

The Ethical Design Manifesto[^46] of ind.ie, a tiny social enterprise founded by Aral Balkan (and others), provides a comprehensive summary to check all aspects of a certain product’s or company’s ethical impact. The three levels of the manifesto are arranged as a pyramid, where human experience (note the using the word ‘human’ instead of ‘user’ or ‘consumer’) is just the top of the structure.



Human rights

Human effort

Human experience

Technology that respects human rights is decentralised, peer-to-peer, zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted, free and open source, interoperable, accessible, and sustainable.

It respects and protects your civil liberties, reduces inequality, and benefits democracy.

Technology that respects human effort is functional, convenient, and reliable.

It is thoughtful and accommodating; not arrogant or demanding. It understands that you might be distracted or differently-abled. It respects the limited time you have on this planet.

Technology that respects human experience is beautiful, magical, and delightful.

It just works. It’s intuitive. It’s invisible. It recedes into the background of your life. It gives you joy. It empowers you with superpowers. It puts a smile on your face and makes your life better.

Although Balkan is mainly worried about the ownership of user’s data, there are several components relevant to attention on all three levels, which I have highlighted above. Balkan puts privacy and ownership of information forward; he cites Shoshana Zuboff’s term ‘Surveillance Capitalism’,[^47] where hooking users to a digital product is instrumental to ‘farm’ them for all the digital information they leave behind. However, the main problem, according to James Williams (a doctoral researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute and the cofounder of the Time Well Spent movement) is exploiting psychological biases. Digital products and services “move us toward goals that may or may not align with our own \[...\] the core challenge of the Internet is that it optimizes more for our impulses than our intentions” [^48]. This disparity is the main concern of the Time Well Spent movement[^49], a “non-profit organization dedicated to creating a humane future where technology is in harmony with our well-being, our social values, and our democratic principles” [^50] founded by Tristan Harris and James Williams. The movement is working to change the situation on three different levels at the same time: empower users, so their choices pressure businesses to change; empower designers to create better products and advocate in their companies for change; and demand governmental pressure for more humane business models and to advise for better policies on user protection.[^51]

To see how the attention economy can threaten well-being, social values, and democratic principles, all depending on several variables, we need to revisit the conclusions of the first part of this research: interferences eating up our limited cognitive capacity, and our information consumption habits, to see how they play out in the long term.

# How is our mind affected?

## Controlling the self and the phone

Recalling the introduction, where the dscout study[^52] was presented, the researchers also asked users to give a quantitative estimate of their interactions with their device, and whether they intended to change their behavior after learning the real number. As it turned out, participants were shocked by the numbers, and then displayed little or no will to change; could participants have considered them ‘touches well spent’? According to the research done by the Time Well Spent movement, the answer is ‘no’. Using data from Moment, an app that tracks smartphone screen time per application, and combining it with user’s self-reports on their level of happiness or regret after using different applications, the results showed that there is an optimal daily use when an app still leaves its users feeling happy, more than that is countereffective [^53]–at least according to their own rating.

Before describing the particular cognitive consequences of the attention economy, it is necessary to shortly address the issue of user’s sense of control over their devices. Why did the empirical evidence about how participants use their own smartphone make them feel powerless instead of empowered?

Although one can try to describe the multifunctionality of smartphones as the digital equivalent of a Swiss army knife, our interactions and emotional relationship to these objects is quite different. The latter is undoubtedly a tool under the (proficient or clumsy) control of whoever is holding it, while the hierarchy of command with the former is not so clear–for instance, our devices can make us jump out of our skins with an unexpected loud ringtone. And if we have been subjected to the methods of Hooked–which we most probably have been, through one digital application or another–then technology may reach out to us inside our minds, offering to deliver information, which informavores [^54] would have trouble forgoing, and for good reason: “Information has value, and the right information has enormous value.” [^55] Still, when information is abundant and attention is scarce, simply increasing our consumption does not automatically guarantee that we will find just the right information. For one, the idea that having access to “more information would automatically make us all smarter as individuals or as a society” is a naïve notion.[^56] Secondly, “\[e\]ven if we evaluate \[our behavior with technology and information intake\] in terms of the goal of optimal foraging of information, it still seems that our behavior is not optimal” [^57]. One of the main features of digital media is the extremely low cost of accessibility, thus rendering the continuing execution of information foraging inept; we design environments with unprecedented access to information, but we do not benefit from it or enjoy it as we intended to. According to James Williams, the main reason behind this anomaly is to be found in how technology creates habits or internal triggers which keep interfering with our top-down goals: “If you get distracted by the same thing in the same way every day, it adds up to a distracted week, distracted months \[...\] it has the effect of making us forget about those \[goals\] that we want to live by” [^58]. Or as Gazzaley and Rosen put it, “\[E\]veryday media multitasking \[...\] is just a generous way of saying that we have lost our awareness of what is necessary and what is simply reflexive responding as though prodded by a sharp stick.” [^59] Our habitually used digital technologies, particularly smartphones, wear down our self-control as the operating systems of our life: they use our finite psychic energy for making micro-decisions about them throughout the day, leaving less for setting and executing higher-level goals–which may explain why using time spent as a design metric could erode well-being, social values and democratic principles. No wonder participants of the dscout study did not feel capable of changing their habits: even when the attention grabbing methods are used for educational[^60] or other admittedly virtuous purposes, they somehow weaken our general resolve.

Since continuing to discuss the question of control and power would lead into the thorny realm of political and human rights, which this thesis does not have the ambition to comprehensively discuss, let’s return to the actual changes in the limits and capabilities of our attention.

## The trail of the spotlight

Imagine looking for a jar of raspberry jam in the dark pantry with a flashlight. How would you start looking for it? Scan each shelf from left to right? Jumping quickly between different points or waving around the lamp would not show you the position of the objects relative to one another, which is necessary for constructing a mental image of the room; otherwise the discovery of the raspberry jam would be left to chance. If the trail of the light was recorded by long-exposure photography, scanning the shelves would show horizontal lines with the occasional diversion, loosely mapping the structure of the room, whereas the waving would draw an incoherent mess of focus points. The more orderly movement would probably reveal the jam sooner.

Carrying further the strong visual metaphor of attention as a flashlight enables us to express the feel of our current habits of media and information consumption. Although looking for a specific object or information in a finite space is the opposite of trying to navigate in the information glut of our current media environment, the choices of movement are analogous. We can randomly direct our focus wherever chance (or rather skillful design) draws it, or move it with intent during the occasional interruptions (direct the light at the floor or at the slight peripheral movement in the corner). Problems arise when we find our attention constantly drawn by the ever-renewing and engaging technological environments: instead of resisting these momentary impulses to find deeper engagement and possibly enjoyment, “the current conditions of our modern, high-tech world perpetuate \[foraging\] by offering us greater accessibility to feed \[our\] instinctive drive and also via their influence on internal factors such as boredom and anxiety.” [^61] From the outside, this is often labelled multitasking, which is in fact only frequent switching between objects and their corresponding neural networks. We experience this when our reading speed significantly slows down if we simultaneously engage in instant messaging.[^62] We recall less of what we have read, even if we don’t switch to the message.[^63] Instead of calmly moving the flashlight of our attention to connect and organize the incoming stimuli to each other and previous experiences, ‘all meaning gives way to mere “information.” ’ [^64]

During frequent network switching, we have adapted to the state of ‘continuous partial attention’ [^65]: our focus is mostly in transit between two objects instead of being actually doubled to contain multiple objects of focus. However, this adaptation comes with a price: “we seem to have lost the ability to single task.” [^66] The mere presence of a smartphone reduces our cognitive capacity “by taxing the attentional resources that reside at the core of both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence.” [^67] Sadly, being aware of these detrimental effects and occasionally getting rid of the smartphone is not a psychologically viable solution. The signs of emotional dependence of users include “phantom pocket vibration syndrome, FOMO (fear of missing out), and nomophobia (fear of being out of mobile phone contact)”.[^68] Though the symptoms are very specific to technology, being afraid of the possibility of boredom, anxiety and loneliness is not. Applying our focus exclusively on one and only one thing was always difficult due to our susceptibility to interference by information. However, an environment that resembles the spaceship in Wall-E [^69] or even a permanently connected phone interferes with our capability to focus on a whole different magnitude than a library.

By now, we have established that the constantly increasing information intake and self-interruption is not optimal for human information consumption and integration, or, to put it more simply, it will make us the opposite of smart and more productive. Giving up some of the comfort provided by devices in order to control their own attention and mental effort is a price that Aral Balkan and other politically motivated technologists are willing to pay to be “free as in freedom”.[^70] For others, the price of being less productive and sharp could be an incentive to resist the internal and external interruptions[^71]. However, rational reasons standing against an emotional pull require constant monitoring of one’s own technological interactions and a whole lot of self-control. On the level of personal well-being, why should we preserve the capability to do one task at a time and withstand moments of boredom? Can we say for sure that the humans of Wall-E in their idle state of constant entertainment are not happy?

## Optimal experience as happiness

> Each person allocates his or her limited attention either by focusing it intentionally like a beam of energy \[...\] or by diffusing it in desultory, random movements. The shape and content of life depend on how attention has been used.[^72]

Defining happiness without getting tangled up in a cultural, philosophical, political and sometimes religious debate is almost impossible, and a task that will probably never be completed; still, deciding whether a certain technology makes us happier requires a pragmatic approach. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi’s book, Flow[^73], from the quite young field of positive psychology, assimilates happiness to having the most optimal experiences during our lifetime, “which is as close as any of us can come to being happy” [^74] and then exploring what constitutes these experiences. Although his findings–based on thousands of interviews, questionnaires and the Experience Sampling Method [^75]–conform to what is intuitively expected, they have not been definitely proven by scientific, in this case psychological research. In the results–coming from different parts of the world and different society types–optimal experience was similarly described regardless of the activity, the participant’s age, gender, location, culture, social class or other variables, and the reasons for enjoying the activity were mostly the same.[^76] Csíkszentmihályi also makes a clear distinction between pleasure and optimal experience (or enjoyment). The former happens when “information in consciousness says that expectations \[...\] have been met” [^77], e.g. eating stops the feeling of hunger, or we feel relaxed by passively watching a familiar movie. Enjoyment goes beyond what is expected to achieve a “sense of novelty, of accomplishment.” [^78] Sports, art, games and some other activities lend themselves easier to the optimal experience, but it is not exclusive to them. Many participants used the term flow for how they felt during these moments, which is how the theory later became popularised. The word is sometimes misused by applying only one or a few of the findings, or mystified as a miraculous experience, when the requirements, though far from easy, are nothing extravagant. They are not binary, achieving them to any measure enables us to experience flow in proportion to how well we fulfilled the criteria; most of them define a behavior of our attentional capacities.

> First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours.[^79] (emphasis by me)

When reviewing the emphasized parts one by one, the first and glaring difference between optimal experience and pleasure is the necessity to confront a task; thus it is harder to attain as we can “experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention”. If someone does invest psychic energy and fully pays attention, she can lose herself in the activity, and emerge with “a stronger, more confident self, because more of their psychic energy has been invested successfully in goals they themselves had chosen to pursue.” Pleasure “helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in consciousness.” What Csíkszentmihályi calls ordered consciousness is “a struggle for establishing control over attention”, not against, but “for the self”. Self-control here stands not for controlling oneself and sticking to the top-down goals with gritted teeth (although sometimes it feels like that) against internal and external bottom-up stimuli, but to control one’s own flashlight of attention, not because it’s virtuous, but because it is “more enjoyable, and \[...\] it builds the self-confidence that allows us to develop skills.” [^80] During an optimal experience, top-down and bottom-up goals merge into one single drive. “When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.” [^81] However, when an incoming information disrupts our goal enactment, it also disturbs the order in our consciousness and rebuilds the divide between bottom-up and top-down goals. To constantly live in flow is impossible, but creating very little of it makes for a dreary life. “Prolonged experiences of \[unordered consciousness\] can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals.” [^82] Transferring the control over our attention and letting in a large number of interferences damages the top-down goal-setting capabilities.

Fully attending to any goal, task or object is really like an investment–it takes some time to reap the rewards. If the initial investment of time and attention does not happen, the task (anything from painting to flossing) that someone skilled in that activity thoroughly enjoys, seems boring to others. The person who can achieve the optimal experience using a certain skill has already “trained their attention to process signals that otherwise would pass unnoticed.” [^83] This applies to tiny chores (e.g. flossing) as well: improving it every day is more fun than hating it every day, transforming it from routine to a possible ritual.[^84] The skilled person sees well-organized information where others see chaos or nothing, and the two latter do not stand much of a chance against instantly accessible and gratifying information.

Remembering the amount of daily interactions with the smartphone and recalling the simultaneous use of screens and the susceptibility for (self-)interferencing, it is easy to comprehend how digital products can disrupt an optimal experience by derailing the intended trail of our focus. Smartphones alone can generate anxiety, even when they are not present. “Out of sight was clearly not out of mind” [^85], making it impossible for their users to sustain full concentration. Distractions and interruptions (even internal ones) snap us out of optimal experiences; exploiting the susceptibility to interferences essentially equals to ruining the free flow of psychic energy or attention.

What is a little less evident is how digital interferences and hooks prevent an experience from becoming optimal in the first place. According to a study cited at the beginning, the second most reported reason for picking up the phone is (intellectual or emotional[^86]) boredom,[^87] which has an important role: “boredom will motivate the pursuit of new goals as the intensity of the current experience fades” [^88]. These moments without action are small windows of opportunity when we can find a new task or goal. “By motivating desire for change from the current state, boredom increases opportunities to attain social, cognitive, emotional and experiential stimulation that could have been missed.” [^89] If these uncomfortable seconds of micro-decision are exploited by the design patterns of products that thrive in the attention economy and provide a seemingly infinite amount of more satisfying information, then giving our full and undivided attention to a challenging task will require truly extraordinary feats of self-control (the gritted teeth kind). After all, as M. Crawford says,“\[w\]hat sort of outlier would you have to be, what sort of freak of self-control, to resist those well-engineered cultural marshmallows?” [^90] Literal or figurative marshmallows do not measure up to the optimal experience, but quite successfully compete for the same limited time and attention. Products hooking our attention most likely deprive us of possibly entering the flow state, which, similarly to how daily distractions add up to distracted weeks and months, turn into extended periods of attentional underinvestment, of stunted self-development and enjoyment.[^91] While losing boredom [^92] is not something to immediately regret, by losing the motivation to pursue new goals, we risks gaining less self-confidence, less meaning and less time well spent in our lives.

“Everything we experience—joy or pain, interest or boredom—is represented in the mind as information.” [^93] By carrying around a constantly connected device in our pocket and by filling the spaces around us with ever-renewing and engaging technological media that gives us more information and others an access to our attention, we are–indirectly and inadvertently–sabotaging our capacity to freely invest our psychic energy and experience true enjoyment. As Csíkszentmihályi states: “If we are able to control \[the incoming flow of\] information, we can decide what our lives will be like.” [^94]

# Getting to attentive design

> Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.[^95]

One thing about design and technology that gives hope (and sometimes causes fear) is that being made by people, it can also be corrected by them (with certain caveats). Still, if the number of daily active users amounts to the billions,[^96] optimism requires a stretch of the imagination. If we recall Collingridge’s statement: “when change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult and time consuming” [^97], then the problems of the attention economy clearly fall in the latter category.

The struggle to organise and deliver information through design and the tension between private economic interests and humanist goals was already present during the 1960s for graphic designers and photographers, particularly in Britain. The First Things First Manifesto[^98], written by Ken Garland and signed by many others, articulated how “the greatest time and effort of those working in the advertising industry are wasted on \[...\] trivial purposes.” [^99] The suggestion addressed to their designer audience was to concentrate their effort and skills on “education and public service tasks that promoted the betterment of society” [^100] without asking for the unrealistic measure of totally abandoning consumer advertising. The designers neither accused their clients of bad intentions, nor the public of being gullible. Though the scale of information overload in 1964 was far from ours, the manifesto started the conversation about the power and responsibility of designing information and communication as attention became a scarcity.

In order to find a way out and forward into a future where we have better options than putting up with the psychological damage described above or cutting ourselves off from all digital information sources, the current digital media ecosystem needs corrections, revisions (and sometimes an overhaul) on all levels. Many designers work on some part of this arduous task; their tools range from small everyday interaction design decisions to full-time activism and research. I have tried to gather and organize a collection from books, articles, public talks and some interviews I conducted with designers with diverse career routes (freelancing, agency, large corporations), who are committed in one way or another to affecting change. While not all of them are necessarily involved with the question of attention, they all try to design ethically, considering long-term effects, and values expressed in qualitative goals next to financial earnings. A comprehensive report and a short profile about each designer is included in the appendix; the key points will be presented below in the relevant solution space.

## High-level ideas: manifestos, regulation, legislation

> \[Giant IT platform companies\] claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near- monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations, aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access.[^101]

One reason that makes designers and engineers optimistic about digital products is the possibility of having a quick and huge impact on a large audience. What many of them fail to clarify is the precise kind of impact they want to make (which would be the first step towards taking responsibility). Would it be beneficial, or is it better to step back and have no impact at all? Are designers themselves capable to assess all the consequences and make the right choice? Is outside regulation necessary? These are some of the questions that I try to review in this section through the interviews and other sources.

Attempted answers to these questions are often laid out in manifestos[^102] such as ind.ie’s Ethical Design Manifesto, Pamela Pavliscak’s Positive Design Manifesto[^103], design&human’s[^104] principles and values, and the Time Well Spent movement’s texts, all of them complemented by conference talks. Although most of them do not point to specific design solutions, they provide a useful starting point for envisioning a different ecology of attention.[^105]

Whereas the Ethical Design Manifesto tries to cover all aspects from technology, economy and design, the Positive Design Manifesto focuses only on the top part of the pyramid (human experience) and gives a set of principles relevant to that. ‘Positive design’ is about “creating possibilities” [^106] by prioritizing autonomy (and later mastery), trust, creativity, connection or community, and meaning. Comparing these qualities with the requirements of ‘optimal experience’, we find many common elements: achieving a goal is linked to autonomy or a sense of control; the disappearing concern for the self implies trusting oneself and the environment; choosing between different possible next steps during flow is essential for creativity; and our invested engagement in a certain task is due to its perceived meaning.

Another declaration of values are the principles and of design&human[^107], Geoffrey Dorne’s company. They originate mainly from user-centered design[^108], which underwent a significant change from its first appearance. At its start, it mostly meant taking users into account while designing technology; now it is a complex field on how to prioritize and harmonize various needs (messaging, data collection) for different groups (clients, users, customers, patients, etc) with sometimes opposing interests. Dorne’s preference for the term ‘human’ to ‘user’ follows Don Norman, who originally popularized the concept of user-centered design, but changed the wording in a later edition[^109]. Design&human’s stance also echoes the sentiment of the First Things First Manifesto when it calls for designers to work in a socially responsible way and utilize their skills for meaningful contribution. His approach, unlike the Positive Design Manifesto, is not directly related to the topic of attention; the link comes from charging the business model of companies thriving in the attention economy with being unethical.

Imposing rules in the form of manifestos or principles on one’s own professional practice is one thing, advocating to regulate everyone else’s is quite another. Before trying to enact policies and legislation, there are softer tools against ‘inattentive designs’ or unethical business models more generally. Geoffrey Dorne’s suggestions include advising companies to pursue success with a different, ethical business model, for example by emulating the ‘bio’ or ‘fair trade’ labels for digital products. Still, discussing the possibilities and limits of legislation is necessary due to its growing scope in protecting digital privacy[^110] (which is closely linked to our subject, as more time spent likely equals more user data).

One striking difference between regulating the ownership of data or attention is that the latter is an intangible and elusive psychological function translated by behavioral measurements with varying degrees of success, while the former consists of very real numbers and text. This subtle, but fundamental difference may at least partly account for the varying, sometimes contradictory answers in the five interviews conducted for this research. Ryan Rumsey, whose career path leads through large enterprises like Apple and Nestlé, would take the quite liberal but sharp regulations for gambling as a possible model. Darja Gartner and Jérémie Fontana, who work at digital design agencies, put slightly more emphasis on regulations. And we might be seeing more regulations in the future, according to Pamela Pavliscak, as the critique of large digital companies is piling up, though the real benefits remain uncertain. As the founder of Change Sciences, an “insights and innovation firm”,[^111] she provides a more detailed description of possible outcomes, e.g. how committing to certain values or goals in the abstract can have surprising downsides: a lower-level designer could take the repercussions for a decision coming from the top; or, like doctors and lawyers, designers and engineers will have to start carrying malpractice insurance after taking some technology-paraphrased version of the Hippocratic Oath. Still, professional codes of ethics are important to her, especially when creating a piece of technology which does not work transparently, e.g. artificial intelligence.

After going through several manifestos and the individual answers on the powerful tools of regulation, the results show varying degrees of personal optimism; also, in the aforementioned cases, the confidence in a designer’s own convictions are mostly inversely proportional to their legal expertise. Laws, rules and other legal boundaries on the conceptual level of design and engineering prove to be necessary, but insufficient to make the psychological damage of attention disappear. It is unclear how to inscribe the ethics of attention in legal terms: it is still very much a work-in-progress as the trade-offs between distraction and entertainment remain unclear; even if it would be somehow condensed into policies and rules, the real impact is unpredictable; and even if it would have the intended effect, it still requires to be applied on a daily basis. Thus we have zoomed in to a smaller, but probably more significant scale: the feasibility of attention-conscious design in everyday practice.

## Everyday business struggles

The discussions happening at companies and agencies probably have a more immediate impact on minimizing the negative effects of the attention economy than conferences and manifestos, as they have the power to change what is ‘business as usual’. However, since these conversations take place behind closed doors, often under non-disclosure agreements, the results are also less transparent or trackable. One can rely mostly on personal examples and anecdotes from blogs and interviews, which do provide some valuable insights.

All of the interviewed designers mentioned keeping to a set of individual rules, such as drawing the line and saying no in specific cases (even if the same rules would be difficult to apply as legislations). Some do not even get started on projects, others negotiate and navigate daily with only few upfront refusals, and in one case it appears possible to select a group of clients whose requests do not generate conflicts between good design and good business.

Geoffrey Dorne, who outputs his guiding principles not only on the website of design&human but on his blog[^112], in his classes and his conference talks, belongs in the first category. Freelancing enables him to turn down unethical proposals and to refuse more than half of all received projects, and mainly, but not exclusively, working with NGO-s and social enterprises. Educating not only other designers but clients, companies and users is also a large part of his work.

Public communication (as opposed to high-stakes meetings) is necessary and effective also for Darja Gartner and Jérémie Fontana: organizing a talk or event for possible future clients about design ethics is easier than having the same conversation over the contract. Turning down a project is only a last resort after long negotiations. (Nevertheless there are design solutions, business models and a few industries they refuse to work for, which are determined by the agency’s ethical code.) There is pressure on both the agency’s and the client’s side: the designers refusing to produce certain design patterns or interactions can result in losing the project. There are times when the client would be open to prioritizing long-term outcomes, but the pressure to deliver immediate results also on their side derails good intentions, pulling down the agency with them as well. In these cases, it may still help to communicate ethical choices as profitable over time by finding an argument or a different success metric; another effective persuasion technique is using analogies. Explaining user research as architectural planning (where walls are much harder to move after being built than on the blueprints) and user testing as a car crash test (the engineering is probably fine, but it’s still necessary) can help. Nevertheless if the clients have not reflected on the deeper goals, don’t intend to produce added value besides the profit, and may have already selected a quantitative metric before approaching the design firm, the chance to sell them qualitative research–which would enable to evaluate the product’s impact on our attentional capacities, or any long-term effect or ethical concern–is slim.

Despite the reasonable assumption that larger enterprises, like Apple and Nestlé–previous workplaces of Ryan Rumsey–, would be able to support the timeframe and costs of measuring complex notions of success, persuading them of the necessity of qualitative research is not any easier than inside a small or mid-sized agency. Ryan Rumsey is used to saying no upfront, negotiating during his time at a company and quitting if that is the only option to preserve his personal integrity.

When he is advocating a certain value or qualitative measures in a current position, one of his tools is to delegate the responsibility of ethics to individuals or work teams instead of a committee, as the latter usually cannot claim real ownership of the positive or negative impact. He also finds that well-communicated design research can change senior-level decisions and avoid coming to a breakpoint (although saying ‘no’ can put the willingness of the company to test). Though all this effort sometimes amounts solely for design to being considered as a problem-solving domain and not an exclusively aesthetic one, Rumsey (unlike Dorne) does not consider non-profits to be easier clients, as “they are still governed by money or time.”

Pamela Pavliscak’s account of ‘business as usual’ at Change Sciences, her own firm, paints a rather optimistic picture compared to the previous ones, which could be explained by the studio’s focus on designing for a humane future of technology. Although she is prepared to refuse certain design solutions, she could not recall a time when she had to do so. Without naming specific companies, she explained that her clients are a self-selecting group from all over the spectrum, all concerned with long-term customer relationships (although not particularly with the principles of the Positive Design Manifesto or ethical design in general), so convincing them about qualitative research is usually superfluous–that is probably what they came for. Many of them come from more traditional industries with established organizations, where planning for 5 or 10 years is not unusual, unlike some purely technological companies who face so much pressure to grab user’s attention right now; at least she hasn’t encountered among her clients a startup with such long vision.[^113]

Pavliscak’s efforts go towards persuading companies to look at unfamiliar models–including inventive metrics–rather than those they are used to, occasionally surprising her clients. She strongly believes in the personal agency of designers, developers, researchers or consultants to facilitate change, as top-down micromanagement is, luckily, often missing. It’s “just a matter of figuring out better ways”. Thus an extensive, but by no means exhaustive collection of these better ways will constitute the next and last part of this research.

## Designer’s tools and solutions

> We’re not addicted to devices, we’re addicted to the information that flows through them. I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information from the outside world.[^114]

Agreeing with Tea Uglow, a designer at Google’s Creative Park in Sydney, on this particular point is as easy as yearning for the utopian vision presented in her talk, “An Internet without screens might look like this” [^115]. The surfaces of this concept are dominated by wood, rocks and other natural materials, while containing all the ‘magic’ of technology–the equivalent of comparing the current environment of workplaces and homes to a vacation spot. However, in the unlikely case that, starting tomorrow, well-informed consumers or forward-thinking companies solely demand technological solutions with no significant drawbacks on our cognitive capacities, the day after tomorrow would not immediately morph into the ‘happy place’ of our daydreaming.

How could the design process change in order to deliver information without distraction or interruption? Even when all external circumstances align, it is not obvious how to figure in attention during the design process; not just the concepts and norms for treating the topic of attention, but existing practices or agreed upon interfaces and solutions are missing, which, in Pamela Pavliscak’s opinion, is precisely what is called for: “in design, we need really thorough, small, concrete steps to follow, and we rely on best practices and conventions”.

Uglow also presented a few interesting and lovable projects, including one in collaboration with the (now closed) BERG studio, that do realize her vision; still, these designs had a specific context: a group of users, like mental health patients, or a specific occasion, like a large event.[^116] Analyzing the merits and limits of other connected products of BERG, e.g. Little Printer (the most famous of them), or other projects sadly exceeds the limits of this research.

From the group designers interviewed for this thesis, relying on trial and error to come up with an original or even poetic solution (backed up by ethnographic observation) is also the preferred approach of Geoffrey Dorne; the classic production flow of wireframes, visual designs and user testing stays the same for all success metric or requirement. However, the freedom and time required for such a process is generally not available to most designers–as one should suspect after reading the previous sections–which does not mean that using qualitative research and creating new design patterns or even interfaces is the privilege of freelancers or independent researcher / designers.

Starting small, let’s see how a designer can experiment in modest ways, e.g. to come up with a more inclusive, ‘holistic’ way of tracking attention that conveys more than time spent, number of visitors or bounce rate, as moving forward probably won’t mean relinquishing attention measures in a business context. In this process, previous attempts to numerically express an emotion or quality could be an inspiration.

A specific example of using an emotive value as a success factor for Jérémie Fontana was trying to measure trust for legal or finance projects, where clients had to upload sensitive documents. These occasions are nevertheless rare, so neither he or Darja Gartner could claim having an identifiable formalized process for these cases (though the agency where Gartner works has a quite strict design flow). The classic design research tools (e.g. user journey, persona, empathy map) can facilitate a deeper understanding, but it’s hard to evaluate whether a long-term goal has been indeed achieved or not, if the agency can follow a project only for a short period and often does not have access to the client’s analytics.

For both Pamela Pavliscak and Ryan Rumsey, picking what to measure is pivotal before deciding how to measure it (and they have more freedom to do so than an average agency, for different reasons). The selection of the principles for the Positive Design Manifesto (autonomy/mastery, trust, creativity, connection/community, meaning) is an appropriate example. Pavliscak gathered the relevant academic research, including the work of Martin Seligman, a co-founder of positive psychology with Csíkszentmihályi[^117], and collected data about people’s high and low points with technology with diary studies, followed by ethnographic interviews, where some patterns emerged. One example is how creating personal meaning from the digital interactions (crafting the perfect playlist, or making a great post for social media, or coming up with a beautiful photo on Instagram) brought more joy and satisfaction than an easy and frictionless user experience.

Larger enterprises, even while demanding quick results, have the advantage of tracking metrics and iterating on a product over a long period, and their decisions are doubly important as smaller companies often follow their lead. In Rumsey’s practice, each request started with defining a successful outcome with the other team, colleague or executive coming to them. Would great design in that case equal increased revenue, or something that moves you emotionally? Depending on quantitative or qualitative aspect of the goal, the time divided between specific activities changes, but the overall design process stays the same. His team was constantly performing qualitative research with a “sense of pragmatism” during a few weeks’ time for each project in order to produce insights, even though “qualitative analysis requires more human hours.” In order to support the increase in costs (or any change in general), Rumsey had to get support from someone more senior, or gradually gain footing among the different teams; in order to achieve this, he sometimes resorted to communication tricks and quantifying whatever they were trying to improve, often with the method of the ‘perceived value scorecard’, a scale of 1 to 5 of basically anything that can’t be directly measured.

The ‘perceived value scorecard’ is merely a way to get people to listen. And the only way I can get them to listen is almost trick them instead of talking about qualitative research. ‘Well, your adoption is 2 out of 5.’ ‘What? I wanna improve that!’ ‘Well, here’s how you can do that.’

The qualitative research resulting in this score could come from diary studies, observations, interviews, which were then rolled into a single number. If their colleagues or the management wanted to get into the detailed research, it was available, but more often than not they did not mind.

For those of us who do mind what constitutes such a number, out of suspicion or curiosity about whether there is a right way to quantify trust, creativity or focus, the short answer is: no, there is no single correct method, but it is worth trying. Pamela Pavliscak also devotes quite a lot of energy to new ways of research in order to see how the criteria of the Positive Design Manifesto can be satisfied in a client project. “\[We\] experiment out loud to try to measure some of these things \[...\] and I think we’re on the right track.” At the same time, she does not think that quantifying everything is necessarily the best approach: “you can’t put a number on an emotion, or on the nature of the relationship or long-term values, \[it’s\] just kind of a stand-in or shorthand for something that you can get started with, looking at, paying attention to... I’m not sure if quantifying is ideal \[...\] for a lot of these things but it does get organizations to pay attention, and it gives a way to look at that goal.” Whereas Rumsey’s team appears to use quantification mainly as a sales strategy, Pavliscak seems to be equally motivated to gain a better understanding and tracking of emotive values.

Change Science’s experiments are made available in SoundingBox, which could be defined as a user research agency that goes beyond simple usability to compare the whole human experiences of websites, providing both qualitative and quantitative results; in a demo screenshot, effort, flow and connection were displayed with a percentage value.[^118] The process of arriving to a single number, as described in the interview, relies on “asking and tweaking questions to gather meaningful answers over simple observation” (unlike Dorne) to create a full picture: “if we’re only observing and trying to articulate the story of the people ourselves, we’re missing out on their story and how they’re making meaning and coherence.” Gathering the necessary information is inspired also by how governments are tracking healthcare, education or other aspects of well-being, which are also constantly revised.

What happens after comprehensive data about attention, trust or meaning have been gathered? Does this data directly orient us towards satisfactory interfaces, interactions or design patterns? Apart from excluding already well-documented dark patterns[^119], not really, not even for Pavliscak. The research of design solutions includes cataloging positive patterns for attention: “It’s something we all need to do.” In Pavliscak’s opinion, entirely new kinds of interaction (e.g. conversational interfaces, wearables, or the overall vision presented by Tea Uglow) are not necessarily going to ease our cognitive load by being more attentive.

Where else can we find research backed design patterns that positively impact our attentional capacities? An article by Joe Edelman, a former designer of the couchsurfing.com[^120] platform and a current collaborator of the Time Well Spent movement, suggests redesigning menus and enhancing them with circumstantial information. Menu options currently present themselves as the only possible solutions for the problem that made us open the menu the first place, when in fact it is a rather constrained and biased selection of options; it might contain the solution when the user’s needs and the creator’s intentions are actually aligned. To spot the misalignment and think of other possible activities “may require that options listings be augmented with likely time costs, likely money costs, the unlikelihood of various hoped-for outcomes, the likelihood of unhoped-for outcomes, whether there are less-costly or better-success-rate options for similar outcomes” [^121]. “In order to display these kinds of cues[^122], we’d need to build giant database about people, about their choices, and about the outcomes of those choices.” [^123] Edelman’s proposal clearly states that the database should be public, hoping for an outcome that “would reshape the media ecosystem and incentives for business.” [^124] While the creation of the database is clearly valuable, and hindering a habit could help breaking the cycle described in Hooked, complicating each interaction with more decision-making is not attentive design; it merely adds another layer of interference (which, granted, might relegate some interruptions into mere distractions). Such an overly complex interface is also very far from Uglow’s utopia of having a “happy place filled with the information we love that feels as natural and as simple as switching on a lightbulb” [^125].

Other tweaks of existing softwares, for example widgets, extensions, extra information in the browser to nudge us, block certain sites, measure and inform about the time spent, number of visits, etc. do empower the user in the present moment, but these band-aids take away time and effort from what should be the main goal: designing interfaces and interactions that do not require an added layer of protection to stay psychologically harmless. Games that promise to improve our cognitive capacities[^126] or digital detox camps are also substitutes, displacing the blame and responsibility on the users of digital product.[^127] Should we really have to run away from the technology that we ourselves created and bought?

Before giving up hope on bridging the present and the desired future of attentive design or merely waiting for the continuation of Pavliscak’s and other’s investigations and experimentations, there is (at least) one set of principles with concrete design suggestions[^128] that can be used right now for attentive design. Amber Case’s book titled Calm Technology–building on Mark Weiser’s already mentioned article, The Coming age of calm technology [^129]–presents general rules and specific examples for bringing calm design to life. The book follows up on the technological changes since the writing of the original article by updating some of the ideas and providing examples and an evaluation tool. The principles are, as follows (the parts of particular relevance for attentive design are highlighted):

I. Technology should require the smallest possible amount of attention.

II. Technology should inform and create calm.

III. Technology should make use of the periphery.

IV. Technology should amplify the best of technology and the best of humanity.

V. Technology can communicate, but doesn’t need to speak.

VI. Technology should work even when it fails.

VII. The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve  the problem.

VIII. Technology should respect social norms.[^130]

The relevance of most of these rules for attentive design is quite evident. Calm communication patterns are necessary to reach a state of deep focus or to keep technology from interrupting social situations. Although Case avoids discussing both the economic incentives to grabbing the center of attention and the entire topic of advertising, it is nevertheless a practical resource for applying attentive design as far as external interferences from technology are concerned.

So far, our research described perception as a binary concept (whether something is lit by the flashlight or not); however, dividing it into zones based on their resolution is helpful to design calm communication patterns. While Weiser only mentions the center and the periphery of attention, Case divides perception into three zones (principles I and III): primary, secondary and tertiary, and advocates using all of them appropriately. “We have high-resolution perception in front of our faces \[...\] We can, however, hear sounds, see shapes, and feel objects without having to directly look at them.” [^131] Most of the functions that we expect from a smartphone should not require our undivided attention, or not for long; calm technology can minimize these interferences (principle II). “Technology should allow us to shift our attention to it very briefly, get the information we need, and shift back, letting us attend to more things in our environment without being overwhelmed.” [^132]

Each of the three zones have their appropriate style of notifications which are not interchangeable: a tiny screen (and larger ones as well) is informative and useful only in the center of our attention, even when not all information it presents merits such a prominent place; meanwhile the secondary and tertiary zones, quite inattentively, are underused by our most common devices. “When a technology forces a low-resolution update into the high-resolution space of your full attention, it wastes your time, attention, and patience.” [^133] Primary attention is usually visual and direct, while the secondary zone’s signals do not need direct and sustained focus to be perceived, mostly consist of sound and touch; tertiary attention catches weak signs such as distant sound, light, or environmental vibration. Each medium uses a different channel, or a combination of them, e.g. the radio occupies the secondary zone, and leaves all the others free, while a screen uses the center of vision, but diminishes all the others zones, which is why a GPS-navigator using sound is much preferred to a tiny screen during driving. Or why a smart watchstrap with a tiny LED and vibration is calmer and more attentive than an Apple Watch.[^134]

Selecting which channel is relevant for a piece of information is based entirely on context and norms (principle VIII). “A trigger has a precondition, a notification state, and a post-condition. When setting up a trigger for a notification, figure out what the precondition or context for the trigger is, then determine what kind(s) of notifications work best, and finally, test your post-condition.” [^135] Whether it should be a status indicator (which can be visual, auditory or haptic), an alert or an alarm depends on many factors: is the environment quiet or filled with a lot of other signals? Is the notification time-sensitive? Can it arrive during a moment when a distraction is unfortunate or even dangerous? Senses also have their peculiar advantages and disadvantages: vision is high-resolution and it functions best in the center of attention, while auditory perception works on the periphery as well; haptic feedback is very personal and alerting, but it is almost imperceptible for others; and so on. According to Case, a designer has to evaluate all these cases and then pick a ‘just loud enough’ signal from all the options (principle V, VII): when a little beep or tone is enough, there is no need to make the kettle or the fridge talk to us. “In fact, most information that comes from devices can be presented in a calm way. This is just a matter of good design.” [^136] Or, as Tea Uglow has put it more explicitly and succinctly: “Your phone is not the Internet’s door bitch.” [^137]

In this last chapter, a wide range of options (collected from books, talks, articles and personal interviews) has been presented. If they are implemented simultaneously by designers, product managers and policymakers, they may transform the current media environment into one that structures more information for the benefit of individual and public attention and less for private economic interests.

# Conclusion

Marching through psychology, economy, design and other domains to follow this research merits the reward of an extremely brief summary. Besides, there is not one individual and all-comprehensive answer to the original question of building sustainable and self-controlled attention through digital design, but several fragments and rough outlines of solutions, each of them meriting further investigation; they cannot all be listed here.

The original problem of experiencing information glut and scarcity of attention in our current media environment has been amply demonstrated by extensive research. After defining attention as the dual process of selectivity and suppression, and noting the internal conflict between high-level top-down goals and stimulus-driven bottom-up perceptions orienting our focus, we looked at how information in itself is deemed valuable and how that makes us susceptible to interferences that derail from previously set goals. Although this is a general human trait, it has never yet been exploited as efficiently as with our always present and connected digital devices. Since reductive measurements of focus are driving economic decisions, hooking attention has become an ultimate business goal, with various negative consequences. The sheer amount of interferences decrease self-control, productivity and increase emotional discomfort; they ultimately reduce the number and length of optimal experiences, resulting in a less enjoyable, satisfying or well-lived life.

In order to reduce private claims on attention and increase its individual and public control, several types of steps are to be taken. On the highest level, the options of legal solutions can set the wide framework; still, legal solutions alone won’t be sufficient. Manifestos or declaration of values give a direction without tools: a compass, not a map. Zooming in to the level of individual business decisions, the adopted behaviors and decision points start to diverge. The admirable intention to align business metrics with personal ethics are not executed the same way by everyone: the negotiations, compromises (or lack thereof) and informative activities happen at different moments of designers’ careers and in different ways. Evaluating each job, each project or each decision, by giving talks, by educating clients and interested people from all professions are all tried and proven tools for raising awareness about our current attentional predicament and creating the means for the actual design research needed to draw the map towards attentive design.

For the design process strictly understood, two areas ought to be revised: success metrics and design patterns. The methods for collecting and using data about attention (and consequently about emotions, experiences and other elusive concepts) are to be reconsidered; at the same time, interactions and interfaces in themselves and in context also have to change. The propositions range from carefully calculated and iteratively evolving metrics, small tweaks in information architecture, a coherent concept for communication patterns, to artistic and playful visions; each of them valuable, however modestly, on the road to attentive design.

# Appendix–Interviews

## Methodology

The interviews were conducted over Skype (Pavliscak, Rumsey, Dorne) or, if possible, in person (Gartner, Fontana). The duration varied between 38 and 71 minutes and the prepared questions were tailored to individual profiles. The conversations followed the interviewed designer’s trail of thought, only making sure all three levels of solution spaces were discussed at some point, then organized the insights in the same structure for easier understanding and comparison.

### Darja Gartner&Jérémie Fontana

Two UX designers who at the time of the interview are working at different digital agencies in Lausanne and run 17slash, a design union together. Darja is, according to her LinkedIn profile, “a graphic designer specializing in art direction and user experience design” doing “design research, sketch wireframes and \[...\] comprehensive prototypes.” Jérémie is “collecting experiences in different digital, advertising and media agencies, working for brands and as a freelance designer” [^138] At the time of the interview, he is an art director of an agency in Lausanne. He is also one of the creators of The Walking Web podcast that discusses webdesign and digital design in French. Both of them are also organisers of Creative Mornings Geneva and other design events. I interviewed them together on their request.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

“Basic human rights \[...\] are black and white and you cannot negotiate some things.” \[Darja\] The right organization to protect users should be an institution with real legislative(?) authority like the EU or the UN, motivated by activists and associations, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The communication can be more challenging than in the everyday context of the agency among colleagues or with clients as politicians can be ill-informed about the digital world, so it’s very important to educate decisionmakers. As the topic of attention hacking is closely linked to privacy issues, high-level regulations should deal with them together. Bottom-up change is happening at the same time as “the whole industry is thinking about going in the right direction because people are not stupid and they are using more and more ad-blockers to bypass all the trackers.” \[Jérémie\]

#### Business & communicating with clients

“We just don’t do that” \[Darja\] As designers, they can and do refuse to produce certain design patterns or interactions, like sending unnecessary notifications or track anything without active consent (though it is sometimes difficult to define precisely what counts as a dark pattern). At Darja’s agency, they also have a strict ethical code of conduct in place excluding not just design patterns but certain business models and a few industries as a whole, e.g. tobacco and arms. Larger companies have even more power, like how Apple gives back some control to the user over their personal data through iOS tools to block certain application’s activity, “setting an example for smaller companies as well” \[Darja\]. This is not a charity decision, as “now it became a competitive advantage for them” \[Jérémie\]. When delivering a project to a client, designers should also focus on making profitable and ethical choices, at the same time while communicating mainly the former ones: “the good way would be to find some other arguments and metrics to convince the client or the stakeholder” \[Jérémie\]. And if having all the facts and figures don’t work, some manipulation can be useful. Illustrating the added value of user research with metaphors can also be effective when trying to convince someone about the importance of data privacy, attention hacking or simply about doing design research at all before jumping into production. Starting with interviews and creating a user journey can be likened to architectural planning, as it’s much easier to move a wall early on in the plan than later when it’s already built, while user testing is similar to car’s crash test–it should work anyway, but feels unsafe to skip it.

“The pressure that they need to deliver is sometimes too important to take good decisions” \[Darja\] Communicating any of these issues in the context of an event or short conference, where future clients can decide for themselves whether they find the information useful or not is easier than under the pressure of negotiating of a contract. Constraints in time and budget push them towards favoring short-term results over “\[picking\] better decisions” which also pushes the agency to accept this situation or to lose the client to another design company. “\[Digital media companies\] really don’t care about the qualitative metrics, only about the time spent on the page, the engagement, the scroll, the clicks.”

“It’s like Silicon Valley \[the series\], honestly...” \[Darja\] Darja’s agency applies a strict design process to any incoming request based on The Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett[139], which goes through the layers of strategy (objectives, needs), scope (functions), structure (interaction), skeleton (interface), and skin (visual design). Starting with the strategy already shows whether the possible client did reflect or not on the problem they are trying to address with their product or service before going to a design studio. What they are asking for is to “grasp that profit, to reach this amount of people, to \[...\] produce that amount of articles or whatever. But they fail actually to shape the values that are going to guide afterwards the product or the service. \[...\] I see it also in my work, even \[...\] small clients \[...\] don’t know why they’re doing it.” \[Darja\] More reflection in the early stage of product development would save a lot of struggle later about how to become and stay profitable and offer real value at the same time. And if a client has already picked a quantitative metric to achieve, they normally won’t be interested in doing or paying for qualitative research, or research at all, “sometimes \[they\] don’t do any UX, \[they\] just jump to Photoshop or Sketch.”\[Jérémie\]

#### Design process

“I don’t know if we can formalize it in a specific process or framework.” \[Jérémie\] Clients in some industries do understand the added value of qualitative research. “I work with some \[legal or finance\] projects \[where\] you have to build \[...\] trust with the product \[...\], so the qualitative metrics are more important. \[...\] they \[have to be\] sure that all documents they are uploading, or all of the personal information they were sharing \[was\] safe. \[...\].” \[Jérémie\] Using trust as a measurement of success is difficult compared to quantitative metrics, “you just plug JS from Google or any other analytic tool, but all the qualitative metrics are more difficult to implement” \[Jérémie\] It’s also difficult to access the data about users when the project is short or the client has already started doing analytics, they “cannot follow the full project from A to Z and after \[...\] the launch” \[Jérémie\] and “most of the time \[...\] you never know if you’ve done a good work or not.” \[Darja\] If accessing basic metrics is already an issue, it’s even harder to try using and somehow measuring qualities, “few designers and companies \[...\] think about that.” However, the classic design research tools (user journey, persona, empathy map) can facilitate a deeper understanding about users and their needs.

### Ryan Rumsey

In his own words, Ryan is a “leader of innovative digital product, design, and front-end development teams [...] delivering large-scale solutions across a wide variety of industries, including Financial Services, Healthcare, IT, Video Games, Customer Experience, and Media. Concentration on developing Experience Strategy, Design and Product Management practices in the enterprise space.” [^140] His past employers include Electronic Arts, where he led employee and customer experience, a Nestlé R&D institution and Apple, where he worked on enterprise tools.

Ryan also writes about how to establish a culture of design in large companies on his Medium blog,[^141] and a popular talk (and blogpost) on how to use design thinking methods to reprioritize one’s professional goals and to figure out what kind of designer one wants to be.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

“It’s all a balance, there’s no black and white to all that.” On a high level, ethics is like religion or politics, everybody has their own truth around it, though there’s a space for regulations similar to gambling. Design can play a role in setting boundaries, but it may be too much for a designer to advocate at governmental or international institutions. “Not saying it’s impossible, but it’s a lot to take on.” However, designers who do that and fight for radical change (e.g. Aral Balkan) make it easier for other designers to reach more satisfying compromises and find a balance between doing good design and good business.

#### Business & communicating with clients

> “There’s maybe a reason why I don’t work at some companies.”

What are these compromises exactly? “As a designer, I make the choices of where my ethics are, where the lines are drawn, and try to work for companies that have the same lines. When I come and work for a company, I challenge them on where they want go to. It’s not just designing products, it’s seeing whether they are willing to be their word?” At the same time, businesses and users also determine what ethics they can live with, and be responsible for that decision, although it’s not easy to come to one and not just about business models but about themselves as designers or human beings. “There will never be a company I work for, a product I purchase that 100% fits everything I align to, I change as well.”

Some concrete steps can be taken to ensure the company and the designer working in it are on the same page: establish and agree on a goal at the beginning, and delegate responsibility to individuals or teams instead of a committee, otherwise there’s no accountability. If the goal agreed upon is not met, then designers “always have choice, to leave a job, to leave a career, to say no, there’s a lot of power in saying that, and saying no is often the best way to measure how willing is the company \[...\] to uphold the same integrity systems, the same ethics. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. I’m not afraid as a designer \[to say\] that it crosses a line for me, that I won’t do that.”

Refusing to design certain things or to leaving a company is a drastic step, well-communicated design research can change senior-level decisions and avoid coming to this breakpoint. This, however, does not mean leaving the business interest or constraints out of the picture. “Even if you’re working at a non-profit, they are still governed by money or time.”

#### Design process

“Qualitative research provides you a voice to the people who you are \[designing for\], whether it’s employees or players. If you don’t do that, then you’re not hearing them, you’re really not serving them.”

The first task at the beginning of a design request was always to define a successful outcome (like agreeing on the goals of the designer and the company before starting to work there), and define a metric for that. “Most people say ‘I want a new shiny thing that is great’ and then we have to do analysis to understand what does great mean for you: does it mean increased revenue, or something that moves you emotionally?”

The overall design process did not change because the metric was quantitative or qualitative, just how they divided time between specific activities, like watching people use the current version of a product. His team was constantly performing qualitative research with a “sense of pragmatism” during a few weeks’ time for each project in order to produce insights, even though “qualitative analysis requires more human hours.”

Designers can advocate for real feedback through doing qualitative research. What they had to do is to find tricky ways to get people to listen. As a way to ease communication between the design team and e.g. senior executives, they developed the ‘perceived value scorecard’, a scale from 1 to 5, which was a way to roll qualitative insights into quantitative metrics.

“The ‘perceived value scorecard’ is merely a way to get people to listen. And the only way I can get them to listen is almost trick them instead of talking about qualitative research. ‘Well, your adoption is 2 out of 5.’ ‘What? I wanna improve that!’ ‘Well, here’s how you can do that.” The qualitative research could mean diary studies, observations, interviews, which were then rolled into this scorecard that was validated by their expertise. If they wanted to get into the detailed research, it’s there, but more often than not their audience did not care.

Overall the struggle was not getting the company to finance qualitative research, but design research in general, which Ryan overcame by softly introducing it one team at a time and see if there’s real willingness to change, which is a different story. They’re more willing to change if someone more senior is demanding change of them, like a CEO. Then they will change. Others say that all of this sounds very interesting, but also really hard, because it’s people, it’s humans. It’s emotions. Which is why “it’s a lot of work to sell them that’s important. They’ve largely been working in environments where nobody does qualitative research.”

### Geoffrey Dorne

Geoffrey is an independent designer and founder of design&human, a design firm putting a strong emphasis on human-based approach (instead of user-centric). His clients include the Red Cross, the Mozilla Foundation, other non-profits, governmental institutions, large enterprises and startups. A graduate of ENSAD Paris, he also worked for two years as a researcher at ENSADLab. He is currently teaching at ENSCI Les Ateliers, and is also a co-creator of The Walking Web podcast that discusses webdesign and digital design in French. The interview was conducted in French, the report (and the reason for any possible misunderstandings) is my translation.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

When it comes to capturing attention through dark patterns, responsibility is divided on three levels: between companies, their employees and their users. Companies like Facebook profit greatly from this business model, designers, information architects, developers might be motivated also by the professional challenge of increasing time spent with the product. The user has the least power to change, but it’s not impossible. Designers can also refuse to work at certain companies, and those who recently apologized for certain features could not have been naive about what they were doing. However, the one with the most agency are the companies themselves, who could be pursuing more interesting business models.

Considering these three levels, legislation could be a very powerful tool, e.g. obligating companies to warn users about collecting data, but it’s hard to write national laws for something that’s not tied to a nation. Another way to give more space and emphasis to ethical design would be on the model of ‘bio’ vegetables and fruits or ‘fair trade’ coffee: consumers might pay more for something that they believe to be better for them and society in the long term.

#### Business & communicating with clients

Another tool to change is educating all three actors through e.g. conferences, like the talk Privacy by design (together with Jérémie Fontana), or blogging, or teaching at design schools. Defining what is successful design (quoting Alain Findeli’s definition): is it something that makes the world more habitable or not? (Living better could mean different qualities: efficient, poetic or funny.) Scalability, etc. does not matter compared to that, and if someone would want to become rich or have a global impact, then they should have picked another profession. This results saying no to more than half of the work requests. Putting forth his values by creating the agency ‘design&human’ is also a way to filter future clients. Choosing to stay a freelancer allows him to evaluate each project, and only agreeing if the client’s business model is or could be aligned with his personal value system. NGO’s or social enterprises are easier to work with in this aspect, but they are not the only ones, and sometimes the only barrier is ignorance in certain things for the clients, and when asked (e.g. to print on recycled paper), they are happy to change.

#### Design process

When it’s possible to use values instead of metrics as a success requirement, what really changes is the research phase. His qualitative research tools are taken from ethnographic observation and anthropological methods learned during the time he spent at ENSAD Lab as a researcher. When he arrived to a problem statement or insight, then the production of wireframes, visual design and user testing is closer to the classical workflow of design projects. Geoffrey is also suspicious about big (quantitative) data, because if everyone has the same data set, then everyone would arrive to the same solution, whereas a qualitative approach could result in something unexpected and original.

### Pamela Pavliscak

Pamela is a founder of Change Sciences, “an insights and innovation firm. \[Their\] work is a cross between future foresight and design thinking, ethnographic research and data science. \[They’ve\] helped a wide range of clients envision and enact a more human, inclusive, and prosperous future for their customers and constituents.” She is also the author of the Positive Design Manifesto that states principles to keep in mind during design that is made to last: autonomy/mastery, trust, creativity, connection and meaning. When asked about how she defined these principles, she said “it’s a combination of looking at personal and other’s research on well-being has uncovered.” “They all kind of live on \[the\] spectrum of happiness, and well-being is part pleasure and enjoyment, part purpose and meaning. \[...\] I started there. And then I started to do some of my own research and look at what is it that people are feeling good about and where are their low points in technology.”

Pamela also teaches at the Pratt Institute and gives talks on different topics concerning emotion and technology. She is the author of Data Informed Product Design, and the soon to be published Designing for Happiness, both from O’Reilly Media.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

“I wonder if it will have other unforeseen consequences that we perhaps need to think about.” We might be seeing more regulations in the digital world as “a lot of these bigger companies are getting so much critique, so much attention right now on these issues, that [...] change [could be] imminent.” However, high-level solutions, e.g. regulations or committing to something in abstract feels riskier than trying to achieve the values of the manifesto in a specific project. “Maybe designers should have something like a Hippocratic Oath, [...] professional organizations have codes of ethics and I think those probably need to be revisited in the age of AI and expanded, because that’s going to touch all of our work. \[...\] The downside is that we can’t just rely on an oath, because I worry that a lower-level designer will take a fall for what is actually a decision \[coming from\] higher-up, and then there are implications for that, for instance [...] there might be lawsuits against not just companies but individuals as there are against doctors and lawyers, would we have to carry malpractice insurance?”

#### Business & communicating with clients

“For people to \[...\] say ‘I don’t have bad intentions’ would probably be pretty rare!” Regulations in themselves won’t solve it all, but neither are they useless. “On the one hand, you hope that there’d be a top-down initiative to take a better course towards well-being, at the same time, we have a lot of agency as designers, developers, researchers, consultants, and what we choose to do, how we choose to do it, what we choose to work on.” And can she herself exercise this agency? “I would feel comfortable with \[saying no to a request\], certainly.”

**“I wonder where or if these conversations are happening”**

“that’s \[...\] been the goal of technology \[...\] to make lives easier, make things fair for people, we all have that impulse if we’ve gotten into technology probably even at the highest level. \[...\] So mostly everyone I’ve worked with feels like they’re striving for a higher goal” and “all our clients are pretty concerned with the customer or the user.” The reason is that “\[her\] clients are a self-selecting group in a lot of ways, because they have already made \[the choice\] to do things a little differently and \[she doesn’t\] have to do a lot of convincing.” “The most forward-thinking companies are trying to think 5 years out, 10 years out, what is long-term customer relationship going to look like rather than just grab attention right now. I think that’s changing, \[but\] I don’t think we’re there yet.” This means some companies are willing to do research over a longer time period and experiment with new ways of understanding their customers. “I can’t talk about specific projects, but I can say that it’s actually all over the spectrum, it’s in very traditional industries like financial services, to e-commerce. Where we’re not seeing it is start-ups and pure tech companies, which I think is interesting. I’m seeing it more in traditional industries or existing organizations that are trying to transform themselves and move into a more digital-virtual state.” And why aren’t technological companies capable to think ahead in their native environment? “There’s just so much pressure on pure tech companies or on startups to get going and show some returns, \[...\] it’s really hard to make that pace, whereas in industries that have already been around a while are used to thinking longer term and so it’s not as rare for them \[to plan\] what kind of relationship are we having with our customers for the next 10 years, because they have already been around that long. Maybe what’s going on it’s just that I personally haven’t worked for any of the tech companies who are thinking \[about long-term strategy\].”

**“It’s just a matter of figuring out better ways to do it”**

Designers have many ways to practice truly customer-centric design, like “encouraging companies to look at different models, include other metrics besides just bottom-line ones \[and then\] looking for new ways to design, and doing it, because a lot of times we don’t have top-down micromanagement on how do we design something, or how we put something together, so designers and developers have a fair amount of agency and make those decisions. It’s just a matter of figuring out better ways to do it and I’m sharing those strategies.” These new ways can be unusual, “clients have been surprised by what we’re trying to gather and measure and it interests them what those results look like, because it’s different from than what they’re seeing \[as\] typical UX and design research.”

#### Design process

Figuring out new ways of research to see how the the criterias of the Positive Design Manifesto can be fulfilled in a client project is challenging. “Anything emotional is pretty difficult, \[...\] you can’t put a number on an emotion, or on the nature of the relationship or long-term values, \[it’s\] just kind of a stand-in or shorthand for something that you can get started with, looking at, paying attention to... I’m not sure if quantifying is ideal \[...\] for a lot of these things but it does get organizations to pay attention, and it gives a way to look at that goal. In that sense, it can be.”

The current state of this search can be tried at Soundingbox, where “Qual and quant are equal citizens.” Here, trust, creativity and connection appear as something that can be expressed with a number. “\[We\] experiment out loud to try to measure some of these things and see if we can come up with something that’s meaningful, and I think we’re on the right track.” What happens in practice is looking for “what other ways could we ask the question, what could we track over time, are there certain behaviors or feelings, \[...\] so that’s what we’re looking and experimenting with in the course of doing studies, or ourselves, in-house and the clients too.” “It’s kind of funny, because we’re really all at this phase, we have some idea of what’s wrong, but how do we fix it, but like I said, I think I’m only starting to get there, and this would be a very rich area of research and thinking as we move forward, but I do have a little bit of a start at it.” As for concrete methods or tools used, she emphasized asking and tweaking questions to gather meaningful answers over simple observation. “I have an almost ideological problem with \[observation\] in a lot of ways because if we’re only observing and trying to articulate the story of the people ourselves, we’re missing out on their story and how they’re making meaning and coherence. It is an experiment, we look at what academic research is relevant, we’re looking at different ways to measure emotional states, a ton of different scales and models that we can use, \[if\] there’s anything we learned in all of this, especially in studying emotion, is that it’s super complicated and I guess I wouldn’t want it any other way.”

The next step would be to figure out how to use these insights. The manifesto is a good reference point, but it is high-level, coming from studying happiness in other disciplines (psychology, behavioral economics, etc.), “these are not anything particularly new, right?” On a higher level, as she has mentioned, designers and businesses need to change the goal or definition of success, and look at e.g. “countries \[...\] tracking healthcare or education or other aspects of well-being.” But during our everyday work “in design, we need really thorough, small, concrete steps to follow, and we rely on best practices and conventions used on other sites,” and designers need to look “at patterns that we know to detract from people’s experience. \[...\] We’re starting to understand dark patterns related to attention \[...\] We can avoid that, but what are the positive patterns or principles that we can use to design with? That’s what I’ve been thinking a lot about. I don’t claim to have all the answers to that.” “I’m just starting to catalog those \[...\] There’s a fair amount of these, we just haven’t really thought about it this way. I certainly don’t have it all figured out. It’s something we all need to do.”

How did she do it? After taking existing research from different fields, most notably positive psychology, including Martin Seligman’s work, she started doing her own research on what are people’s high and low points with technology, when does it make them feel good. The answers came through diary studies, followed by ethnographic interviews. “It was all over the place in a lot of ways, but once I got enough diary entries and enough people thinking about it and trying to document this at several points during their day, when was technology contributing to their well-being and when was it detracting, some patterns emerged and that’s where those principles come into way. They mostly align with a lot of other frameworks, except I think creativity is unique and interesting, \[...\] not the kind of creativity that we maybe think of as designers, where we’re thinking of making something really fabulous from start to finish, but instead people thought about small doses, like crafting the perfect playlist to share with their friends or making a really great post or coming up with a beautiful photo on Instagram. \[...\] There’ll always be room to improve, but it’s unique partly because it gives people satisfaction and joy, and partly because they’re making their own meaning, it’s not finished and easy and frictionless, there’s something for them to do that is meaningful. I think that’s really important to keep in mind, because \[...\] on one hand we’re driving for people’s attention, on the other hand, we’re very concerned with making it easy, frictionless, convenient, \[...\] that runs counter to a lot of the things that make people happy sometimes with technology. It’s not always the case, but in a lot of cases people want some kind of meaningful way to engage.”

Does the manifesto or thinking about attention change what kind of interfaces she works with? “Absolutely. \[...\] There’s a place for doing a better job for attention on all levels, screens take a lot of our attention, so \[in\] that perspective, it might actually be good to get off, to move ourselves off the screens and focus on other areas like conversational UI and some bots, wearables.” “I don’t know if we can assume that it will be automatically better if we get the screens out of the picture. I think it probably does have a positive impact in a lot of ways.” “\[... But\] we can’t automatically assume those things are gonna be better for our well-being or our attention, because of the nature of human beings, we’re weird and wonderful, and sometimes we’ve awful relationships with technology.”

[^8] In this study, the average daily screen time was ‘only’ 145 minutes, and 225 minutes for heavy users, but the interactions done on a locked phone screen, like viewing a new notification or message, were not counted. These untracked interactions actually add up to almost half of all phone interactions, so the results most likely are fairly similar in this and the previous study which measured screen time.

[^56] The quote is from Ev Williams, founder of Twitter, who was prompted by this realisation to call out a significant amount of tweets as “junk food”: pieces of content that are very effective in grabbing our attention and rewarding the creators and shareholders of a platform (Twitter, in his case), but otherwise has no inherent value. In order to halt the creation of “junk food”, the feedback loop of likes, hearts, retweets, etc. should be broken, as all of them are signs of other users (or bots) paying attention. However, until the platform includes these functions, the content will be shaped by them, and the applications will keep sending us notifications about them. Medium.com, Ev Williams’ new platform designed to generate thoughtful reading and writing, replaced the initial heart-like with claps that can be of varying lengths to express the degree of satisfaction with the article.

[^84] The available benefits stemming from attentiveness to mechanical activities is described well in the book of Sennett, Richard: The Craftsman. Ebook. 2008, Penguin Books, London. “At its higher reaches, technique is no longer a mechanical activity; people can feel fully and think deeply what they are doing once they do it well.” With full focus, almost any activity can be an opportunity to order our consciousness, still, it is exhausting to try this with every activity.

[^92] Isn’t it ironic when we don’t find anything interesting in our environment because we did not develop the skills to perceive the little signals, thus boredom actually increases? But let’s not go down that rabbit hole.

[^107] The principles are as follows:

Any design product is an act with meanings and intentions.

Form is the result of its product.

Innovation is social, not technological.

Design is a responsible and ethical work.

A product must be understood by its user, not the opposite.

Design can be poetic and human only if it is free and based on truth.

Design is to everyone’s attention whereas it’s open to all.

A designer shall guide its work with ethics and shall refuse to do some things.

In a human perspective, all technological possibilities aren’t to be done.

Design is human-centered before being product-centered.

[^116] Another fitting example is The Screenless Office, an artistic proposition initiated by Brendan Howell: remain as connected as current workplaces are, but produce and consume information solely on paper. The tools (printers, barcode scanners, etc.) exist, but this alternative vision–excluding Microsoft, Apple and several other large hardware companies that produce similar screen-centered objects–is even hard to envision. “These interfaces have become so embedded in our conception of reality that we now have a crisis of the imagination, where it is difficult to even think of anything different.” The Screenless Office. screenl.es/diversity.html (accessed September 14, 2017)

[^134] The question whether some wearables or smart jewelries that filter notifications are useful is more uncertain. Their screenless communication patterns can reduce screen interactions on the smartphone and keep notifications in the secondary or tertiary attentional zone. However, at the same time they bring notifications directly on the body without being able to deal with them, possibly prompting the user to pull out their phone more often.
