# Appendix–Interviews

## Methodology

The interviews were conducted over Skype (Pavliscak, Rumsey, Dorne) or, if possible, in person (Gartner, Fontana). The duration varied between 38 and 71 minutes and the prepared questions were tailored to individual profiles. The conversations followed the interviewed designer’s trail of thought, only making sure all three levels of solution spaces were discussed at some point, then organized the insights in the same structure for easier understanding and comparison.

### Darja Gartner&Jérémie Fontana

Two UX designers who at the time of the interview are working at different digital agencies in Lausanne and run 17slash, a design union together. Darja is, according to her LinkedIn profile, “a graphic designer specializing in art direction and user experience design” doing “design research, sketch wireframes and \[...\] comprehensive prototypes.” Jérémie is “collecting experiences in different digital, advertising and media agencies, working for brands and as a freelance designer” [^138] At the time of the interview, he is an art director of an agency in Lausanne. He is also one of the creators of The Walking Web podcast that discusses webdesign and digital design in French. Both of them are also organisers of Creative Mornings Geneva and other design events. I interviewed them together on their request.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

“Basic human rights \[...\] are black and white and you cannot negotiate some things.” \[Darja\] The right organization to protect users should be an institution with real legislative(?) authority like the EU or the UN, motivated by activists and associations, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The communication can be more challenging than in the everyday context of the agency among colleagues or with clients as politicians can be ill-informed about the digital world, so it’s very important to educate decisionmakers. As the topic of attention hacking is closely linked to privacy issues, high-level regulations should deal with them together. Bottom-up change is happening at the same time as “the whole industry is thinking about going in the right direction because people are not stupid and they are using more and more ad-blockers to bypass all the trackers.” \[Jérémie\]

#### Business & communicating with clients

“We just don’t do that” \[Darja\] As designers, they can and do refuse to produce certain design patterns or interactions, like sending unnecessary notifications or track anything without active consent (though it is sometimes difficult to define precisely what counts as a dark pattern). At Darja’s agency, they also have a strict ethical code of conduct in place excluding not just design patterns but certain business models and a few industries as a whole, e.g. tobacco and arms. Larger companies have even more power, like how Apple gives back some control to the user over their personal data through iOS tools to block certain application’s activity, “setting an example for smaller companies as well” \[Darja\]. This is not a charity decision, as “now it became a competitive advantage for them” \[Jérémie\]. When delivering a project to a client, designers should also focus on making profitable and ethical choices, at the same time while communicating mainly the former ones: “the good way would be to find some other arguments and metrics to convince the client or the stakeholder” \[Jérémie\]. And if having all the facts and figures don’t work, some manipulation can be useful. Illustrating the added value of user research with metaphors can also be effective when trying to convince someone about the importance of data privacy, attention hacking or simply about doing design research at all before jumping into production. Starting with interviews and creating a user journey can be likened to architectural planning, as it’s much easier to move a wall early on in the plan than later when it’s already built, while user testing is similar to car’s crash test–it should work anyway, but feels unsafe to skip it.

“The pressure that they need to deliver is sometimes too important to take good decisions” \[Darja\] Communicating any of these issues in the context of an event or short conference, where future clients can decide for themselves whether they find the information useful or not is easier than under the pressure of negotiating of a contract. Constraints in time and budget push them towards favoring short-term results over “\[picking\] better decisions” which also pushes the agency to accept this situation or to lose the client to another design company. “\[Digital media companies\] really don’t care about the qualitative metrics, only about the time spent on the page, the engagement, the scroll, the clicks.”

“It’s like Silicon Valley \[the series\], honestly...” \[Darja\] Darja’s agency applies a strict design process to any incoming request based on The Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett[139], which goes through the layers of strategy (objectives, needs), scope (functions), structure (interaction), skeleton (interface), and skin (visual design). Starting with the strategy already shows whether the possible client did reflect or not on the problem they are trying to address with their product or service before going to a design studio. What they are asking for is to “grasp that profit, to reach this amount of people, to \[...\] produce that amount of articles or whatever. But they fail actually to shape the values that are going to guide afterwards the product or the service. \[...\] I see it also in my work, even \[...\] small clients \[...\] don’t know why they’re doing it.” \[Darja\] More reflection in the early stage of product development would save a lot of struggle later about how to become and stay profitable and offer real value at the same time. And if a client has already picked a quantitative metric to achieve, they normally won’t be interested in doing or paying for qualitative research, or research at all, “sometimes \[they\] don’t do any UX, \[they\] just jump to Photoshop or Sketch.”\[Jérémie\]

#### Design process

“I don’t know if we can formalize it in a specific process or framework.” \[Jérémie\] Clients in some industries do understand the added value of qualitative research. “I work with some \[legal or finance\] projects \[where\] you have to build \[...\] trust with the product \[...\], so the qualitative metrics are more important. \[...\] they \[have to be\] sure that all documents they are uploading, or all of the personal information they were sharing \[was\] safe. \[...\].” \[Jérémie\] Using trust as a measurement of success is difficult compared to quantitative metrics, “you just plug JS from Google or any other analytic tool, but all the qualitative metrics are more difficult to implement” \[Jérémie\] It’s also difficult to access the data about users when the project is short or the client has already started doing analytics, they “cannot follow the full project from A to Z and after \[...\] the launch” \[Jérémie\] and “most of the time \[...\] you never know if you’ve done a good work or not.” \[Darja\] If accessing basic metrics is already an issue, it’s even harder to try using and somehow measuring qualities, “few designers and companies \[...\] think about that.” However, the classic design research tools (user journey, persona, empathy map) can facilitate a deeper understanding about users and their needs.

### Ryan Rumsey

In his own words, Ryan is a “leader of innovative digital product, design, and front-end development teams [...] delivering large-scale solutions across a wide variety of industries, including Financial Services, Healthcare, IT, Video Games, Customer Experience, and Media. Concentration on developing Experience Strategy, Design and Product Management practices in the enterprise space.” [^140] His past employers include Electronic Arts, where he led employee and customer experience, a Nestlé R&D institution and Apple, where he worked on enterprise tools.

Ryan also writes about how to establish a culture of design in large companies on his Medium blog,[^141] and a popular talk (and blogpost) on how to use design thinking methods to reprioritize one’s professional goals and to figure out what kind of designer one wants to be.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

“It’s all a balance, there’s no black and white to all that.” On a high level, ethics is like religion or politics, everybody has their own truth around it, though there’s a space for regulations similar to gambling. Design can play a role in setting boundaries, but it may be too much for a designer to advocate at governmental or international institutions. “Not saying it’s impossible, but it’s a lot to take on.” However, designers who do that and fight for radical change (e.g. Aral Balkan) make it easier for other designers to reach more satisfying compromises and find a balance between doing good design and good business.

#### Business & communicating with clients

> “There’s maybe a reason why I don’t work at some companies.”

What are these compromises exactly? “As a designer, I make the choices of where my ethics are, where the lines are drawn, and try to work for companies that have the same lines. When I come and work for a company, I challenge them on where they want go to. It’s not just designing products, it’s seeing whether they are willing to be their word?” At the same time, businesses and users also determine what ethics they can live with, and be responsible for that decision, although it’s not easy to come to one and not just about business models but about themselves as designers or human beings. “There will never be a company I work for, a product I purchase that 100% fits everything I align to, I change as well.”

Some concrete steps can be taken to ensure the company and the designer working in it are on the same page: establish and agree on a goal at the beginning, and delegate responsibility to individuals or teams instead of a committee, otherwise there’s no accountability. If the goal agreed upon is not met, then designers “always have choice, to leave a job, to leave a career, to say no, there’s a lot of power in saying that, and saying no is often the best way to measure how willing is the company \[...\] to uphold the same integrity systems, the same ethics. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. I’m not afraid as a designer \[to say\] that it crosses a line for me, that I won’t do that.”

Refusing to design certain things or to leaving a company is a drastic step, well-communicated design research can change senior-level decisions and avoid coming to this breakpoint. This, however, does not mean leaving the business interest or constraints out of the picture. “Even if you’re working at a non-profit, they are still governed by money or time.”

#### Design process

“Qualitative research provides you a voice to the people who you are \[designing for\], whether it’s employees or players. If you don’t do that, then you’re not hearing them, you’re really not serving them.”

The first task at the beginning of a design request was always to define a successful outcome (like agreeing on the goals of the designer and the company before starting to work there), and define a metric for that. “Most people say ‘I want a new shiny thing that is great’ and then we have to do analysis to understand what does great mean for you: does it mean increased revenue, or something that moves you emotionally?”

The overall design process did not change because the metric was quantitative or qualitative, just how they divided time between specific activities, like watching people use the current version of a product. His team was constantly performing qualitative research with a “sense of pragmatism” during a few weeks’ time for each project in order to produce insights, even though “qualitative analysis requires more human hours.”

Designers can advocate for real feedback through doing qualitative research. What they had to do is to find tricky ways to get people to listen. As a way to ease communication between the design team and e.g. senior executives, they developed the ‘perceived value scorecard’, a scale from 1 to 5, which was a way to roll qualitative insights into quantitative metrics.

“The ‘perceived value scorecard’ is merely a way to get people to listen. And the only way I can get them to listen is almost trick them instead of talking about qualitative research. ‘Well, your adoption is 2 out of 5.’ ‘What? I wanna improve that!’ ‘Well, here’s how you can do that.” The qualitative research could mean diary studies, observations, interviews, which were then rolled into this scorecard that was validated by their expertise. If they wanted to get into the detailed research, it’s there, but more often than not their audience did not care.

Overall the struggle was not getting the company to finance qualitative research, but design research in general, which Ryan overcame by softly introducing it one team at a time and see if there’s real willingness to change, which is a different story. They’re more willing to change if someone more senior is demanding change of them, like a CEO. Then they will change. Others say that all of this sounds very interesting, but also really hard, because it’s people, it’s humans. It’s emotions. Which is why “it’s a lot of work to sell them that’s important. They’ve largely been working in environments where nobody does qualitative research.”

### Geoffrey Dorne

Geoffrey is an independent designer and founder of design&human, a design firm putting a strong emphasis on human-based approach (instead of user-centric). His clients include the Red Cross, the Mozilla Foundation, other non-profits, governmental institutions, large enterprises and startups. A graduate of ENSAD Paris, he also worked for two years as a researcher at ENSADLab. He is currently teaching at ENSCI Les Ateliers, and is also a co-creator of The Walking Web podcast that discusses webdesign and digital design in French. The interview was conducted in French, the report (and the reason for any possible misunderstandings) is my translation.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

When it comes to capturing attention through dark patterns, responsibility is divided on three levels: between companies, their employees and their users. Companies like Facebook profit greatly from this business model, designers, information architects, developers might be motivated also by the professional challenge of increasing time spent with the product. The user has the least power to change, but it’s not impossible. Designers can also refuse to work at certain companies, and those who recently apologized for certain features could not have been naive about what they were doing. However, the one with the most agency are the companies themselves, who could be pursuing more interesting business models.

Considering these three levels, legislation could be a very powerful tool, e.g. obligating companies to warn users about collecting data, but it’s hard to write national laws for something that’s not tied to a nation. Another way to give more space and emphasis to ethical design would be on the model of ‘bio’ vegetables and fruits or ‘fair trade’ coffee: consumers might pay more for something that they believe to be better for them and society in the long term.

#### Business & communicating with clients

Another tool to change is educating all three actors through e.g. conferences, like the talk Privacy by design (together with Jérémie Fontana), or blogging, or teaching at design schools. Defining what is successful design (quoting Alain Findeli’s definition): is it something that makes the world more habitable or not? (Living better could mean different qualities: efficient, poetic or funny.) Scalability, etc. does not matter compared to that, and if someone would want to become rich or have a global impact, then they should have picked another profession. This results saying no to more than half of the work requests. Putting forth his values by creating the agency ‘design&human’ is also a way to filter future clients. Choosing to stay a freelancer allows him to evaluate each project, and only agreeing if the client’s business model is or could be aligned with his personal value system. NGO’s or social enterprises are easier to work with in this aspect, but they are not the only ones, and sometimes the only barrier is ignorance in certain things for the clients, and when asked (e.g. to print on recycled paper), they are happy to change.

#### Design process

When it’s possible to use values instead of metrics as a success requirement, what really changes is the research phase. His qualitative research tools are taken from ethnographic observation and anthropological methods learned during the time he spent at ENSAD Lab as a researcher. When he arrived to a problem statement or insight, then the production of wireframes, visual design and user testing is closer to the classical workflow of design projects. Geoffrey is also suspicious about big (quantitative) data, because if everyone has the same data set, then everyone would arrive to the same solution, whereas a qualitative approach could result in something unexpected and original.

### Pamela Pavliscak

Pamela is a founder of Change Sciences, “an insights and innovation firm. \[Their\] work is a cross between future foresight and design thinking, ethnographic research and data science. \[They’ve\] helped a wide range of clients envision and enact a more human, inclusive, and prosperous future for their customers and constituents.” She is also the author of the Positive Design Manifesto that states principles to keep in mind during design that is made to last: autonomy/mastery, trust, creativity, connection and meaning. When asked about how she defined these principles, she said “it’s a combination of looking at personal and other’s research on well-being has uncovered.” “They all kind of live on \[the\] spectrum of happiness, and well-being is part pleasure and enjoyment, part purpose and meaning. \[...\] I started there. And then I started to do some of my own research and look at what is it that people are feeling good about and where are their low points in technology.”

Pamela also teaches at the Pratt Institute and gives talks on different topics concerning emotion and technology. She is the author of Data Informed Product Design, and the soon to be published Designing for Happiness, both from O’Reilly Media.

#### Regulation, high-level solutions

“I wonder if it will have other unforeseen consequences that we perhaps need to think about.” We might be seeing more regulations in the digital world as “a lot of these bigger companies are getting so much critique, so much attention right now on these issues, that [...] change [could be] imminent.” However, high-level solutions, e.g. regulations or committing to something in abstract feels riskier than trying to achieve the values of the manifesto in a specific project. “Maybe designers should have something like a Hippocratic Oath, [...] professional organizations have codes of ethics and I think those probably need to be revisited in the age of AI and expanded, because that’s going to touch all of our work. \[...\] The downside is that we can’t just rely on an oath, because I worry that a lower-level designer will take a fall for what is actually a decision \[coming from\] higher-up, and then there are implications for that, for instance [...] there might be lawsuits against not just companies but individuals as there are against doctors and lawyers, would we have to carry malpractice insurance?”

#### Business & communicating with clients

“For people to \[...\] say ‘I don’t have bad intentions’ would probably be pretty rare!” Regulations in themselves won’t solve it all, but neither are they useless. “On the one hand, you hope that there’d be a top-down initiative to take a better course towards well-being, at the same time, we have a lot of agency as designers, developers, researchers, consultants, and what we choose to do, how we choose to do it, what we choose to work on.” And can she herself exercise this agency? “I would feel comfortable with \[saying no to a request\], certainly.”

**“I wonder where or if these conversations are happening”**

“that’s \[...\] been the goal of technology \[...\] to make lives easier, make things fair for people, we all have that impulse if we’ve gotten into technology probably even at the highest level. \[...\] So mostly everyone I’ve worked with feels like they’re striving for a higher goal” and “all our clients are pretty concerned with the customer or the user.” The reason is that “\[her\] clients are a self-selecting group in a lot of ways, because they have already made \[the choice\] to do things a little differently and \[she doesn’t\] have to do a lot of convincing.” “The most forward-thinking companies are trying to think 5 years out, 10 years out, what is long-term customer relationship going to look like rather than just grab attention right now. I think that’s changing, \[but\] I don’t think we’re there yet.” This means some companies are willing to do research over a longer time period and experiment with new ways of understanding their customers. “I can’t talk about specific projects, but I can say that it’s actually all over the spectrum, it’s in very traditional industries like financial services, to e-commerce. Where we’re not seeing it is start-ups and pure tech companies, which I think is interesting. I’m seeing it more in traditional industries or existing organizations that are trying to transform themselves and move into a more digital-virtual state.” And why aren’t technological companies capable to think ahead in their native environment? “There’s just so much pressure on pure tech companies or on startups to get going and show some returns, \[...\] it’s really hard to make that pace, whereas in industries that have already been around a while are used to thinking longer term and so it’s not as rare for them \[to plan\] what kind of relationship are we having with our customers for the next 10 years, because they have already been around that long. Maybe what’s going on it’s just that I personally haven’t worked for any of the tech companies who are thinking \[about long-term strategy\].”

**“It’s just a matter of figuring out better ways to do it”**

Designers have many ways to practice truly customer-centric design, like “encouraging companies to look at different models, include other metrics besides just bottom-line ones \[and then\] looking for new ways to design, and doing it, because a lot of times we don’t have top-down micromanagement on how do we design something, or how we put something together, so designers and developers have a fair amount of agency and make those decisions. It’s just a matter of figuring out better ways to do it and I’m sharing those strategies.” These new ways can be unusual, “clients have been surprised by what we’re trying to gather and measure and it interests them what those results look like, because it’s different from than what they’re seeing \[as\] typical UX and design research.”

#### Design process

Figuring out new ways of research to see how the the criterias of the Positive Design Manifesto can be fulfilled in a client project is challenging. “Anything emotional is pretty difficult, \[...\] you can’t put a number on an emotion, or on the nature of the relationship or long-term values, \[it’s\] just kind of a stand-in or shorthand for something that you can get started with, looking at, paying attention to... I’m not sure if quantifying is ideal \[...\] for a lot of these things but it does get organizations to pay attention, and it gives a way to look at that goal. In that sense, it can be.”

The current state of this search can be tried at Soundingbox, where “Qual and quant are equal citizens.” Here, trust, creativity and connection appear as something that can be expressed with a number. “\[We\] experiment out loud to try to measure some of these things and see if we can come up with something that’s meaningful, and I think we’re on the right track.” What happens in practice is looking for “what other ways could we ask the question, what could we track over time, are there certain behaviors or feelings, \[...\] so that’s what we’re looking and experimenting with in the course of doing studies, or ourselves, in-house and the clients too.” “It’s kind of funny, because we’re really all at this phase, we have some idea of what’s wrong, but how do we fix it, but like I said, I think I’m only starting to get there, and this would be a very rich area of research and thinking as we move forward, but I do have a little bit of a start at it.” As for concrete methods or tools used, she emphasized asking and tweaking questions to gather meaningful answers over simple observation. “I have an almost ideological problem with \[observation\] in a lot of ways because if we’re only observing and trying to articulate the story of the people ourselves, we’re missing out on their story and how they’re making meaning and coherence. It is an experiment, we look at what academic research is relevant, we’re looking at different ways to measure emotional states, a ton of different scales and models that we can use, \[if\] there’s anything we learned in all of this, especially in studying emotion, is that it’s super complicated and I guess I wouldn’t want it any other way.”

The next step would be to figure out how to use these insights. The manifesto is a good reference point, but it is high-level, coming from studying happiness in other disciplines (psychology, behavioral economics, etc.), “these are not anything particularly new, right?” On a higher level, as she has mentioned, designers and businesses need to change the goal or definition of success, and look at e.g. “countries \[...\] tracking healthcare or education or other aspects of well-being.” But during our everyday work “in design, we need really thorough, small, concrete steps to follow, and we rely on best practices and conventions used on other sites,” and designers need to look “at patterns that we know to detract from people’s experience. \[...\] We’re starting to understand dark patterns related to attention \[...\] We can avoid that, but what are the positive patterns or principles that we can use to design with? That’s what I’ve been thinking a lot about. I don’t claim to have all the answers to that.” “I’m just starting to catalog those \[...\] There’s a fair amount of these, we just haven’t really thought about it this way. I certainly don’t have it all figured out. It’s something we all need to do.”

How did she do it? After taking existing research from different fields, most notably positive psychology, including Martin Seligman’s work, she started doing her own research on what are people’s high and low points with technology, when does it make them feel good. The answers came through diary studies, followed by ethnographic interviews. “It was all over the place in a lot of ways, but once I got enough diary entries and enough people thinking about it and trying to document this at several points during their day, when was technology contributing to their well-being and when was it detracting, some patterns emerged and that’s where those principles come into way. They mostly align with a lot of other frameworks, except I think creativity is unique and interesting, \[...\] not the kind of creativity that we maybe think of as designers, where we’re thinking of making something really fabulous from start to finish, but instead people thought about small doses, like crafting the perfect playlist to share with their friends or making a really great post or coming up with a beautiful photo on Instagram. \[...\] There’ll always be room to improve, but it’s unique partly because it gives people satisfaction and joy, and partly because they’re making their own meaning, it’s not finished and easy and frictionless, there’s something for them to do that is meaningful. I think that’s really important to keep in mind, because \[...\] on one hand we’re driving for people’s attention, on the other hand, we’re very concerned with making it easy, frictionless, convenient, \[...\] that runs counter to a lot of the things that make people happy sometimes with technology. It’s not always the case, but in a lot of cases people want some kind of meaningful way to engage.”

Does the manifesto or thinking about attention change what kind of interfaces she works with? “Absolutely. \[...\] There’s a place for doing a better job for attention on all levels, screens take a lot of our attention, so \[in\] that perspective, it might actually be good to get off, to move ourselves off the screens and focus on other areas like conversational UI and some bots, wearables.” “I don’t know if we can assume that it will be automatically better if we get the screens out of the picture. I think it probably does have a positive impact in a lot of ways.” “\[... But\] we can’t automatically assume those things are gonna be better for our well-being or our attention, because of the nature of human beings, we’re weird and wonderful, and sometimes we’ve awful relationships with technology.”
