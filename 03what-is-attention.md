## What is attention?

In order to understand why it is so easy to be induced to spend as much time in front of screens as the above-mentioned studies indicate, even when we recognize it may be against our longer-term interest, we obviously have to look at what cognitive science tells us about how the attentional aspects of the human brain work. Humans have struggled with attention issues and cognitive control long before the appearance of Facebook, the internet or screens in general.

One of the main difficulties in talking about and measuring human attention is that it is a multi-layered concept referring to multiple processes at the same time. The theory I will use throughout this research is the one proposed by Adam Gazzaley and Dr. Larry D. Rosen in their book The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World[^14]. The most important component of attention singled out by Gazzaley and Rosen is selectivity: directing the brain’s resources on a goal, while ignoring everything else. Attending and suppressing, however, are two distinct processes, both using our limited cognitive resources. One common metaphor used to describe selectivity (and attention) is the spotlight, which sheds focused light on something while leaving everything else in relative darkness. This metaphor also enables to easily circumscribe three types of attentional limitations relating to when (expectation), where (directionality) and how long (sustainability) something remains within the scope of its light.[^15]

The expectation relative to the selection of an object depends on past events, present internal goals or external perceptions and future actions, or to put it simply, one notices what one is searching for. The direction can be internal or external: if we want to recall a memory or name, we need to ignore external stimuli as well as internal ones, e.g. hunger. Sustaining the spotlight of our attention on an object depends on the present state of our brain (fatigue, age, time of day, etc) and how engaging that object is, which in turn depends on the individual’s motivations and goals, connecting back to the aspect of expectation. Maintaining our focus for an extended period of time can become uncomfortable, and is often perceived as lingering on a boring object or situation.

To sum it up, attention is one’s available cognitive capacity divided between selecting an object to focus on and suppressing all other stimuli, and what controls the process of selection and suppression is expecting, directing and sustaining our cognitive capacity on an object.

Another important factor mentioned by Gazzaley and Rosen is our limited working memory. The function of the working memory is to hold information in our mind for a brief amount of time when a stimulus is no longer present, bridging perception and future action.[^16] To connect incoming information with our next move it is necessary to maintain a sense of continuity, and this connection can be easily disturbed as there is only so much information (7± 2 “chunks” according to Miller’s law[^17]) that one person can hold in their mind at the same time.

Last, but not least, it is important to note how setting goals is much easier than enacting them, which is where the crucial notion of interference enters the picture. Gazzaley and Rosen characterise interference as “something that hinders, obstructs, impedes, or largely derails another process” [^18]. Interferences can be internal, going on only in our minds, or external, like an alarm or a warning sign. If we decide to engage with an internal or external interference and change our course of action, it is a case of interruption. If, in spite of the interference, we continue with our action, Gazzaley and Rosen propose that we talk of an internal or external distraction, as shown on the following diagram.

If someone talks to you while you are reading this, that’s a case of external distraction. If you respond, then the other person’s comment becomes an interruption. However if you linger on a previous comment of this person while reading the next day, that is an internal distraction. If it stops you in your reading, than you have internally self-interrupted yourself.

Although in the last paragraphs, the susceptibility to interferences appears to be a flaw of our mind, it should in fact count as a vital component of the survival skills for mobile organisms. Noticing the quiet steps of a predator or the glimmering of a stream could mean life or death in prehistoric times. In the contemporary urban environment, one could say red traffic lights interfere in the task of driving to our destination in order to save the pedestrians (and the driver from prison time). On the down side, interferences disturb the process of selectivity, make it more challenging to ignore irrelevant stimuli or fill up the working memory with information which may be irrelevant. Interruptions also force the mind to engage in multitasking, which, as we will see, is merely switching between different goals and neural networks.

There are so many things that can interfere with executing even a simple task, as everyone can confirm who has been standing in their kitchen and not knowing why and how they got there. Potential interferences multiply as our goals get more complicated and distant in space and time. A general principle is that the more complex a system (our own mind, our goals or our environment), the more vulnerable it becomes to interferences. As Gazzaley and Rosen put it,

> \[t\]he conflict is between our goal-setting abilities, which are so highly evolved \[...\] and our goal-enactment abilities, which have not evolved much at all from our primitive ancestors \[..\]. It is this conflict that results in goal interference, and generates a palpable tension in our minds—a tension between what we want to do and what
we can do.[^19]

The gap of what we could do and what we actually achieve is an important illustration of the limits of our attention. In typical cases, our goal-setting is the result of a top-down internal thought process started by inserting a time delay to pause and reflect between perception and action. It is in this short timeframe that we exercise executive functions: we evaluate the situation and decide on our next action. Indeed the scale of top-down control is what mostly makes the human mind special.[^20] Goals alter not only our actions but also our perception of the world[^21], and often conflict with external, stimulus-driven bottom-up influences that prompt automatic actions. To demystify what this means, let’s take an example from our digital environment: you set the top-down goal of writing down a reminder on your phone when walking out of the office in the evening. However, there are two notifications on the lockscreen: a work email and an app’s marketing message, prompting you to take a decision: engage with them, delay them or ignore them. Let’s say you delete the marketing message, but you check the work email, which may delay the original goal (writing a reminder), or make you forget it. Or you can go on with the reminder and then check the email, or go on ignoring the email until next morning (although it may occasionally pop up in your head during the evening.) Among many other interferences, the red traffic light at the pedestrian crossing in front of the office is vital in order to not step in front of a car while executing the top-down goal of writing this reminder; still, glancing up to the traffic light slows down the original goal of typing the reminder. However, the two bottom-up perceptions of notifications on the lock screen also required immediate decision-making and maybe further engagement, and may have even distracted you from the traffic light.

Interferences in themselves are necessary to perceive and interact with our environment: other people, urban spaces or nature. Since these signals come from a given context, most of them are specific and relevant to our current situation, unlike the omnipresent smartphones and all the notifications that reach out everywhere, at all times.
