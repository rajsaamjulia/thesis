## Controlling the self and the phone

Recalling the introduction, where the dscout study[^52] was presented, the researchers also asked users to give a quantitative estimate of their interactions with their device, and whether they intended to change their behavior after learning the real number. As it turned out, participants were shocked by the numbers, and then displayed little or no will to change; could participants have considered them ‘touches well spent’? According to the research done by the Time Well Spent movement, the answer is ‘no’. Using data from Moment, an app that tracks smartphone screen time per application, and combining it with user’s self-reports on their level of happiness or regret after using different applications, the results showed that there is an optimal daily use when an app still leaves its users feeling happy, more than that is countereffective [^53]–at least according to their own rating.

Before describing the particular cognitive consequences of the attention economy, it is necessary to shortly address the issue of user’s sense of control over their devices. Why did the empirical evidence about how participants use their own smartphone make them feel powerless instead of empowered?

Although one can try to describe the multifunctionality of smartphones as the digital equivalent of a Swiss army knife, our interactions and emotional relationship to these objects is quite different. The latter is undoubtedly a tool under the (proficient or clumsy) control of whoever is holding it, while the hierarchy of command with the former is not so clear–for instance, our devices can make us jump out of our skins with an unexpected loud ringtone. And if we have been subjected to the methods of Hooked–which we most probably have been, through one digital application or another–then technology may reach out to us inside our minds, offering to deliver information, which informavores [^54] would have trouble forgoing, and for good reason: “Information has value, and the right information has enormous value.” [^55] Still, when information is abundant and attention is scarce, simply increasing our consumption does not automatically guarantee that we will find just the right information. For one, the idea that having access to “more information would automatically make us all smarter as individuals or as a society” is a naïve notion.[^56] Secondly, “\[e\]ven if we evaluate \[our behavior with technology and information intake\] in terms of the goal of optimal foraging of information, it still seems that our behavior is not optimal” [^57]. One of the main features of digital media is the extremely low cost of accessibility, thus rendering the continuing execution of information foraging inept; we design environments with unprecedented access to information, but we do not benefit from it or enjoy it as we intended to. According to James Williams, the main reason behind this anomaly is to be found in how technology creates habits or internal triggers which keep interfering with our top-down goals: “If you get distracted by the same thing in the same way every day, it adds up to a distracted week, distracted months \[...\] it has the effect of making us forget about those \[goals\] that we want to live by” [^58]. Or as Gazzaley and Rosen put it, “\[E\]veryday media multitasking \[...\] is just a generous way of saying that we have lost our awareness of what is necessary and what is simply reflexive responding as though prodded by a sharp stick.” [^59] Our habitually used digital technologies, particularly smartphones, wear down our self-control as the operating systems of our life: they use our finite psychic energy for making micro-decisions about them throughout the day, leaving less for setting and executing higher-level goals–which may explain why using time spent as a design metric could erode well-being, social values and democratic principles. No wonder participants of the dscout study did not feel capable of changing their habits: even when the attention grabbing methods are used for educational[^60] or other admittedly virtuous purposes, they somehow weaken our general resolve.

Since continuing to discuss the question of control and power would lead into the thorny realm of political and human rights, which this thesis does not have the ambition to comprehensively discuss, let’s return to the actual changes in the limits and capabilities of our attention.

[^56] The quote is from Ev Williams, founder of Twitter, who was prompted by this realisation to call out a significant amount of tweets as “junk food”: pieces of content that are very effective in grabbing our attention and rewarding the creators and shareholders of a platform (Twitter, in his case), but otherwise has no inherent value. In order to halt the creation of “junk food”, the feedback loop of likes, hearts, retweets, etc. should be broken, as all of them are signs of other users (or bots) paying attention. However, until the platform includes these functions, the content will be shaped by them, and the applications will keep sending us notifications about them. Medium.com, Ev Williams’ new platform designed to generate thoughtful reading and writing, replaced the initial heart-like with claps that can be of varying lengths to express the degree of satisfaction with the article.
