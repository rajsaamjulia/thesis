## The trail of the spotlight

Imagine looking for a jar of raspberry jam in the dark pantry with a flashlight. How would you start looking for it? Scan each shelf from left to right? Jumping quickly between different points or waving around the lamp would not show you the position of the objects relative to one another, which is necessary for constructing a mental image of the room; otherwise the discovery of the raspberry jam would be left to chance. If the trail of the light was recorded by long-exposure photography, scanning the shelves would show horizontal lines with the occasional diversion, loosely mapping the structure of the room, whereas the waving would draw an incoherent mess of focus points. The more orderly movement would probably reveal the jam sooner.

Carrying further the strong visual metaphor of attention as a flashlight enables us to express the feel of our current habits of media and information consumption. Although looking for a specific object or information in a finite space is the opposite of trying to navigate in the information glut of our current media environment, the choices of movement are analogous. We can randomly direct our focus wherever chance (or rather skillful design) draws it, or move it with intent during the occasional interruptions (direct the light at the floor or at the slight peripheral movement in the corner). Problems arise when we find our attention constantly drawn by the ever-renewing and engaging technological environments: instead of resisting these momentary impulses to find deeper engagement and possibly enjoyment, “the current conditions of our modern, high-tech world perpetuate \[foraging\] by offering us greater accessibility to feed \[our\] instinctive drive and also via their influence on internal factors such as boredom and anxiety.” [^61] From the outside, this is often labelled multitasking, which is in fact only frequent switching between objects and their corresponding neural networks. We experience this when our reading speed significantly slows down if we simultaneously engage in instant messaging.[^62] We recall less of what we have read, even if we don’t switch to the message.[^63] Instead of calmly moving the flashlight of our attention to connect and organize the incoming stimuli to each other and previous experiences, ‘all meaning gives way to mere “information.” ’ [^64]

During frequent network switching, we have adapted to the state of ‘continuous partial attention’ [^65]: our focus is mostly in transit between two objects instead of being actually doubled to contain multiple objects of focus. However, this adaptation comes with a price: “we seem to have lost the ability to single task.” [^66] The mere presence of a smartphone reduces our cognitive capacity “by taxing the attentional resources that reside at the core of both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence.” [^67] Sadly, being aware of these detrimental effects and occasionally getting rid of the smartphone is not a psychologically viable solution. The signs of emotional dependence of users include “phantom pocket vibration syndrome, FOMO (fear of missing out), and nomophobia (fear of being out of mobile phone contact)”.[^68] Though the symptoms are very specific to technology, being afraid of the possibility of boredom, anxiety and loneliness is not. Applying our focus exclusively on one and only one thing was always difficult due to our susceptibility to interference by information. However, an environment that resembles the spaceship in Wall-E [^69] or even a permanently connected phone interferes with our capability to focus on a whole different magnitude than a library.

By now, we have established that the constantly increasing information intake and self-interruption is not optimal for human information consumption and integration, or, to put it more simply, it will make us the opposite of smart and more productive. Giving up some of the comfort provided by devices in order to control their own attention and mental effort is a price that Aral Balkan and other politically motivated technologists are willing to pay to be “free as in freedom”.[^70] For others, the price of being less productive and sharp could be an incentive to resist the internal and external interruptions[^71]. However, rational reasons standing against an emotional pull require constant monitoring of one’s own technological interactions and a whole lot of self-control. On the level of personal well-being, why should we preserve the capability to do one task at a time and withstand moments of boredom? Can we say for sure that the humans of Wall-E in their idle state of constant entertainment are not happy?
