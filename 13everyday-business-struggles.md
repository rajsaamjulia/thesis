## Everyday business struggles

The discussions happening at companies and agencies probably have a more immediate impact on minimizing the negative effects of the attention economy than conferences and manifestos, as they have the power to change what is ‘business as usual’. However, since these conversations take place behind closed doors, often under non-disclosure agreements, the results are also less transparent or trackable. One can rely mostly on personal examples and anecdotes from blogs and interviews, which do provide some valuable insights.

All of the interviewed designers mentioned keeping to a set of individual rules, such as drawing the line and saying no in specific cases (even if the same rules would be difficult to apply as legislations). Some do not even get started on projects, others negotiate and navigate daily with only few upfront refusals, and in one case it appears possible to select a group of clients whose requests do not generate conflicts between good design and good business.

Geoffrey Dorne, who outputs his guiding principles not only on the website of design&human but on his blog[^112], in his classes and his conference talks, belongs in the first category. Freelancing enables him to turn down unethical proposals and to refuse more than half of all received projects, and mainly, but not exclusively, working with NGO-s and social enterprises. Educating not only other designers but clients, companies and users is also a large part of his work.

Public communication (as opposed to high-stakes meetings) is necessary and effective also for Darja Gartner and Jérémie Fontana: organizing a talk or event for possible future clients about design ethics is easier than having the same conversation over the contract. Turning down a project is only a last resort after long negotiations. (Nevertheless there are design solutions, business models and a few industries they refuse to work for, which are determined by the agency’s ethical code.) There is pressure on both the agency’s and the client’s side: the designers refusing to produce certain design patterns or interactions can result in losing the project. There are times when the client would be open to prioritizing long-term outcomes, but the pressure to deliver immediate results also on their side derails good intentions, pulling down the agency with them as well. In these cases, it may still help to communicate ethical choices as profitable over time by finding an argument or a different success metric; another effective persuasion technique is using analogies. Explaining user research as architectural planning (where walls are much harder to move after being built than on the blueprints) and user testing as a car crash test (the engineering is probably fine, but it’s still necessary) can help. Nevertheless if the clients have not reflected on the deeper goals, don’t intend to produce added value besides the profit, and may have already selected a quantitative metric before approaching the design firm, the chance to sell them qualitative research–which would enable to evaluate the product’s impact on our attentional capacities, or any long-term effect or ethical concern–is slim.

Despite the reasonable assumption that larger enterprises, like Apple and Nestlé–previous workplaces of Ryan Rumsey–, would be able to support the timeframe and costs of measuring complex notions of success, persuading them of the necessity of qualitative research is not any easier than inside a small or mid-sized agency. Ryan Rumsey is used to saying no upfront, negotiating during his time at a company and quitting if that is the only option to preserve his personal integrity.

When he is advocating a certain value or qualitative measures in a current position, one of his tools is to delegate the responsibility of ethics to individuals or work teams instead of a committee, as the latter usually cannot claim real ownership of the positive or negative impact. He also finds that well-communicated design research can change senior-level decisions and avoid coming to a breakpoint (although saying ‘no’ can put the willingness of the company to test). Though all this effort sometimes amounts solely for design to being considered as a problem-solving domain and not an exclusively aesthetic one, Rumsey (unlike Dorne) does not consider non-profits to be easier clients, as “they are still governed by money or time.”

Pamela Pavliscak’s account of ‘business as usual’ at Change Sciences, her own firm, paints a rather optimistic picture compared to the previous ones, which could be explained by the studio’s focus on designing for a humane future of technology. Although she is prepared to refuse certain design solutions, she could not recall a time when she had to do so. Without naming specific companies, she explained that her clients are a self-selecting group from all over the spectrum, all concerned with long-term customer relationships (although not particularly with the principles of the Positive Design Manifesto or ethical design in general), so convincing them about qualitative research is usually superfluous–that is probably what they came for. Many of them come from more traditional industries with established organizations, where planning for 5 or 10 years is not unusual, unlike some purely technological companies who face so much pressure to grab user’s attention right now; at least she hasn’t encountered among her clients a startup with such long vision.[^113]

Pavliscak’s efforts go towards persuading companies to look at unfamiliar models–including inventive metrics–rather than those they are used to, occasionally surprising her clients. She strongly believes in the personal agency of designers, developers, researchers or consultants to facilitate change, as top-down micromanagement is, luckily, often missing. It’s “just a matter of figuring out better ways”. Thus an extensive, but by no means exhaustive collection of these better ways will constitute the next and last part of this research.
