# Introduction

> What matters is not technology itself, but its relationship to us.[^1]

The place of technology in our lives is (still) changing. It feels like digital devices are designed and redesigned to get physically and mentally closer to us, and as they get smaller, they can be embedded in more spaces and situations. Though we often leave desktop computers at their own dedicated place, their pocket-sized versions come with us everywhere, and even smaller ones are starting to claim space on, and perhaps even in our bodies as wearables. However, shrinking the size of computers and normalizing their use in most life situations was a process neither instantaneous nor fully unexpected.

Mark Weiser in his seminal paper The Coming Age of Calm Technology [^2] (1996) outlined the major waves of computing, considering them as changes that fundamentally alter the place of technology in our lives. The first wave is linked to the invention of the mainframe computer from the 1940s, where many people share one computer, followed by the wave of one personal computer for each person in the 1980s. According to Weiser, the next step would take place when the internet would connect personal computers, ushering in the current wave of ubiquitous computing. Each person would use several devices. These devices also provide a constant and instantly accessible source of information (that is, when the bandwidth is wide enough and the battery is charged). Smartphones act as an ‘external brain’, keeping us constantly connected not only to information that we selected to store, but also to anything that is accessible through the World Wide  Web.

All computers and peripheral devices collect, process and provide information between themselves, their users and more recently (and problematically) to different companies offering services through them.

The observation motivating my reflection on Attentive Design is that with the overabundance of technologically mediated information available at any given moment, attention has become the new scarcity, as Herbert Simon famously pointed out decades before the appearance of the internet:

In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.[^3]

The wealth, or even glut, of information is hardly debatable, but to ascertain whether it really saturates our attention capacity, it is important to measure how much of our time and attention is actually spent interacting with different computers, especially smartphones over the last few years. According to a 2013 study by Nokia, people looked at their phones an astonishing 150 times per day on average [^4], while iPhone users in 2016 unlocked their devices 80 times per day on average [^5]. Another study measuring the difference between self-estimated and real smartphone usage on Android devices arrived to a similar number, more than double of what participants estimated about themselves.[^6] People trying to quantify other aspects of their smartphone use in the same research were similarly inaccurate. The daily active phone use added up to more than 5 hours (including when the screens were not used, like listening to music), and 55% of all uses were less than 30 seconds long.

A different approach is to measure not how often we look at but how often we touch the screens of our phones,[^7] which is more than 2600 times per day for an average user, and passes 5400 touches per day for a heavy user.[^8] It is noteworthy that when participants learned about these numbers, they did not resolve to change their habits; currently it seems tough to avoid 80 glances or 2600 touches a day. Also, being able to connect anytime and anywhere has made us expect quasi-immediate responsivity from others at all times.[^9] It is important to note that the time spent on our smartphones is not actually the total time spent with screens, since we often use several of them simultaneously. However, laptops and televisions do not permeate all areas of our lives, and are more often viewed together with other people.

The reasons we glance or pick up our smartphones vary from simple things like checking the time or turning off the alarm to reading the news, writing emails and communicate with loved (and less loved) ones throughout the day. It can inform, remind and entertain, or even help us avoid other people. After coordinating meetings, the second most reported reason to engage with smartphones was to avoid boredom[^10] (a fact which will turn out to be important later on in this research).

All in all, we look at the screen of the smartphone around 80 times a day, touch it probably more than any other object and definitely more than any other person (except maybe babies for their main caregivers). According to Tristan Harris’s popular essay How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds [^11], the reason behind such an intimate relationship with our phones is that “if, at any moment, reality gets dull or boring, our phone offers something more pleasurable, more productive and even more educational than whatever reality gives us.” However, escaping from boring moments will not necessarily amount to “time well spent” [12] or a “life well lived” ,[13] as this thesis will attempt to demonstrate. Starting with a definition of attention, we examine our relationship to incoming information and this connection’s vulnerabilities in an overwhelming media environment, and how these susceptibilities enable technological companies to design for grabbing and monetizing human attention. After analyzing how these design tools and methods affect our mind and well-being, we will conclude with a chapter about possible design solutions for protecting our attentional capabilities; the proposals–coming from books, articles, talks, other documents and in-person interviews–range from high-level ideas to concrete everyday steps.

[^8] In this study, the average daily screen time was ‘only’ 145 minutes, and 225 minutes for heavy users, but the interactions done on a locked phone screen, like viewing a new notification or message, were not counted. These untracked interactions actually add up to almost half of all phone interactions, so the results most likely are fairly similar in this and the previous study which measured screen time.
