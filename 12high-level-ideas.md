## High-level ideas: manifestos, regulation, legislation

> \[Giant IT platform companies\] claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near- monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations, aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access.[^101]

One reason that makes designers and engineers optimistic about digital products is the possibility of having a quick and huge impact on a large audience. What many of them fail to clarify is the precise kind of impact they want to make (which would be the first step towards taking responsibility). Would it be beneficial, or is it better to step back and have no impact at all? Are designers themselves capable to assess all the consequences and make the right choice? Is outside regulation necessary? These are some of the questions that I try to review in this section through the interviews and other sources.

Attempted answers to these questions are often laid out in manifestos[^102] such as ind.ie’s Ethical Design Manifesto, Pamela Pavliscak’s Positive Design Manifesto[^103], design&human’s[^104] principles and values, and the Time Well Spent movement’s texts, all of them complemented by conference talks. Although most of them do not point to specific design solutions, they provide a useful starting point for envisioning a different ecology of attention.[^105]

Whereas the Ethical Design Manifesto tries to cover all aspects from technology, economy and design, the Positive Design Manifesto focuses only on the top part of the pyramid (human experience) and gives a set of principles relevant to that. ‘Positive design’ is about “creating possibilities” [^106] by prioritizing autonomy (and later mastery), trust, creativity, connection or community, and meaning. Comparing these qualities with the requirements of ‘optimal experience’, we find many common elements: achieving a goal is linked to autonomy or a sense of control; the disappearing concern for the self implies trusting oneself and the environment; choosing between different possible next steps during flow is essential for creativity; and our invested engagement in a certain task is due to its perceived meaning.

Another declaration of values are the principles and of design&human[^107], Geoffrey Dorne’s company. They originate mainly from user-centered design[^108], which underwent a significant change from its first appearance. At its start, it mostly meant taking users into account while designing technology; now it is a complex field on how to prioritize and harmonize various needs (messaging, data collection) for different groups (clients, users, customers, patients, etc) with sometimes opposing interests. Dorne’s preference for the term ‘human’ to ‘user’ follows Don Norman, who originally popularized the concept of user-centered design, but changed the wording in a later edition[^109]. Design&human’s stance also echoes the sentiment of the First Things First Manifesto when it calls for designers to work in a socially responsible way and utilize their skills for meaningful contribution. His approach, unlike the Positive Design Manifesto, is not directly related to the topic of attention; the link comes from charging the business model of companies thriving in the attention economy with being unethical.

Imposing rules in the form of manifestos or principles on one’s own professional practice is one thing, advocating to regulate everyone else’s is quite another. Before trying to enact policies and legislation, there are softer tools against ‘inattentive designs’ or unethical business models more generally. Geoffrey Dorne’s suggestions include advising companies to pursue success with a different, ethical business model, for example by emulating the ‘bio’ or ‘fair trade’ labels for digital products. Still, discussing the possibilities and limits of legislation is necessary due to its growing scope in protecting digital privacy[^110] (which is closely linked to our subject, as more time spent likely equals more user data).

One striking difference between regulating the ownership of data or attention is that the latter is an intangible and elusive psychological function translated by behavioral measurements with varying degrees of success, while the former consists of very real numbers and text. This subtle, but fundamental difference may at least partly account for the varying, sometimes contradictory answers in the five interviews conducted for this research. Ryan Rumsey, whose career path leads through large enterprises like Apple and Nestlé, would take the quite liberal but sharp regulations for gambling as a possible model. Darja Gartner and Jérémie Fontana, who work at digital design agencies, put slightly more emphasis on regulations. And we might be seeing more regulations in the future, according to Pamela Pavliscak, as the critique of large digital companies is piling up, though the real benefits remain uncertain. As the founder of Change Sciences, an “insights and innovation firm”,[^111] she provides a more detailed description of possible outcomes, e.g. how committing to certain values or goals in the abstract can have surprising downsides: a lower-level designer could take the repercussions for a decision coming from the top; or, like doctors and lawyers, designers and engineers will have to start carrying malpractice insurance after taking some technology-paraphrased version of the Hippocratic Oath. Still, professional codes of ethics are important to her, especially when creating a piece of technology which does not work transparently, e.g. artificial intelligence.

After going through several manifestos and the individual answers on the powerful tools of regulation, the results show varying degrees of personal optimism; also, in the aforementioned cases, the confidence in a designer’s own convictions are mostly inversely proportional to their legal expertise. Laws, rules and other legal boundaries on the conceptual level of design and engineering prove to be necessary, but insufficient to make the psychological damage of attention disappear. It is unclear how to inscribe the ethics of attention in legal terms: it is still very much a work-in-progress as the trade-offs between distraction and entertainment remain unclear; even if it would be somehow condensed into policies and rules, the real impact is unpredictable; and even if it would have the intended effect, it still requires to be applied on a daily basis. Thus we have zoomed in to a smaller, but probably more significant scale: the feasibility of attention-conscious design in everyday practice.

[^107] The principles are as follows:

Any design product is an act with meanings and intentions.

Form is the result of its product.

Innovation is social, not technological.

Design is a responsible and ethical work.

A product must be understood by its user, not the opposite.

Design can be poetic and human only if it is free and based on truth.

Design is to everyone’s attention whereas it’s open to all.

A designer shall guide its work with ethics and shall refuse to do some things.

In a human perspective, all technological possibilities aren’t to be done.

Design is human-centered before being product-centered.
