# Acknowledgements

First I would like to thank the designers who took the time from their busy schedules to talk and give a glimpse into their professional lives: Pamela Pavliscak, Ryan Rumsey and Geoffrey Dorne; and especially to Jérémie Fontana and Darja Gartner, who also helped me reach Ryan and Geoffrey.

I would also like to express my gratitude Daniel Sciboz for helping me obtain the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship, and the Federal Commission for Scholarships for Foreign Students FCS for financing my studies. In addition, I would like to thank Nicolas Nova for his enthusiastic guidance at the start of the research.

Finally I would like to thank Daniel Pinkas for the patient and thorough corrections, and for being a constant source of the references this thesis needed. I have been extremely lucky to have a tutor who cared so much about my work.
