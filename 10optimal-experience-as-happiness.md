## Optimal experience as happiness

> Each person allocates his or her limited attention either by focusing it intentionally like a beam of energy \[...\] or by diffusing it in desultory, random movements. The shape and content of life depend on how attention has been used.[^72]

Defining happiness without getting tangled up in a cultural, philosophical, political and sometimes religious debate is almost impossible, and a task that will probably never be completed; still, deciding whether a certain technology makes us happier requires a pragmatic approach. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi’s book, Flow[^73], from the quite young field of positive psychology, assimilates happiness to having the most optimal experiences during our lifetime, “which is as close as any of us can come to being happy” [^74] and then exploring what constitutes these experiences. Although his findings–based on thousands of interviews, questionnaires and the Experience Sampling Method [^75]–conform to what is intuitively expected, they have not been definitely proven by scientific, in this case psychological research. In the results–coming from different parts of the world and different society types–optimal experience was similarly described regardless of the activity, the participant’s age, gender, location, culture, social class or other variables, and the reasons for enjoying the activity were mostly the same.[^76] Csíkszentmihályi also makes a clear distinction between pleasure and optimal experience (or enjoyment). The former happens when “information in consciousness says that expectations \[...\] have been met” [^77], e.g. eating stops the feeling of hunger, or we feel relaxed by passively watching a familiar movie. Enjoyment goes beyond what is expected to achieve a “sense of novelty, of accomplishment.” [^78] Sports, art, games and some other activities lend themselves easier to the optimal experience, but it is not exclusive to them. Many participants used the term flow for how they felt during these moments, which is how the theory later became popularised. The word is sometimes misused by applying only one or a few of the findings, or mystified as a miraculous experience, when the requirements, though far from easy, are nothing extravagant. They are not binary, achieving them to any measure enables us to experience flow in proportion to how well we fulfilled the criteria; most of them define a behavior of our attentional capacities.

> First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours.[^79] (emphasis by me)

When reviewing the emphasized parts one by one, the first and glaring difference between optimal experience and pleasure is the necessity to confront a task; thus it is harder to attain as we can “experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention”. If someone does invest psychic energy and fully pays attention, she can lose herself in the activity, and emerge with “a stronger, more confident self, because more of their psychic energy has been invested successfully in goals they themselves had chosen to pursue.” Pleasure “helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in consciousness.” What Csíkszentmihályi calls ordered consciousness is “a struggle for establishing control over attention”, not against, but “for the self”. Self-control here stands not for controlling oneself and sticking to the top-down goals with gritted teeth (although sometimes it feels like that) against internal and external bottom-up stimuli, but to control one’s own flashlight of attention, not because it’s virtuous, but because it is “more enjoyable, and \[...\] it builds the self-confidence that allows us to develop skills.” [^80] During an optimal experience, top-down and bottom-up goals merge into one single drive. “When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.” [^81] However, when an incoming information disrupts our goal enactment, it also disturbs the order in our consciousness and rebuilds the divide between bottom-up and top-down goals. To constantly live in flow is impossible, but creating very little of it makes for a dreary life. “Prolonged experiences of \[unordered consciousness\] can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals.” [^82] Transferring the control over our attention and letting in a large number of interferences damages the top-down goal-setting capabilities.

Fully attending to any goal, task or object is really like an investment–it takes some time to reap the rewards. If the initial investment of time and attention does not happen, the task (anything from painting to flossing) that someone skilled in that activity thoroughly enjoys, seems boring to others. The person who can achieve the optimal experience using a certain skill has already “trained their attention to process signals that otherwise would pass unnoticed.” [^83] This applies to tiny chores (e.g. flossing) as well: improving it every day is more fun than hating it every day, transforming it from routine to a possible ritual.[^84] The skilled person sees well-organized information where others see chaos or nothing, and the two latter do not stand much of a chance against instantly accessible and gratifying information.

Remembering the amount of daily interactions with the smartphone and recalling the simultaneous use of screens and the susceptibility for (self-)interferencing, it is easy to comprehend how digital products can disrupt an optimal experience by derailing the intended trail of our focus. Smartphones alone can generate anxiety, even when they are not present. “Out of sight was clearly not out of mind” [^85], making it impossible for their users to sustain full concentration. Distractions and interruptions (even internal ones) snap us out of optimal experiences; exploiting the susceptibility to interferences essentially equals to ruining the free flow of psychic energy or attention.

What is a little less evident is how digital interferences and hooks prevent an experience from becoming optimal in the first place. According to a study cited at the beginning, the second most reported reason for picking up the phone is (intellectual or emotional[^86]) boredom,[^87] which has an important role: “boredom will motivate the pursuit of new goals as the intensity of the current experience fades” [^88]. These moments without action are small windows of opportunity when we can find a new task or goal. “By motivating desire for change from the current state, boredom increases opportunities to attain social, cognitive, emotional and experiential stimulation that could have been missed.” [^89] If these uncomfortable seconds of micro-decision are exploited by the design patterns of products that thrive in the attention economy and provide a seemingly infinite amount of more satisfying information, then giving our full and undivided attention to a challenging task will require truly extraordinary feats of self-control (the gritted teeth kind). After all, as M. Crawford says,“\[w\]hat sort of outlier would you have to be, what sort of freak of self-control, to resist those well-engineered cultural marshmallows?” [^90] Literal or figurative marshmallows do not measure up to the optimal experience, but quite successfully compete for the same limited time and attention. Products hooking our attention most likely deprive us of possibly entering the flow state, which, similarly to how daily distractions add up to distracted weeks and months, turn into extended periods of attentional underinvestment, of stunted self-development and enjoyment.[^91] While losing boredom [^92] is not something to immediately regret, by losing the motivation to pursue new goals, we risks gaining less self-confidence, less meaning and less time well spent in our lives.

“Everything we experience—joy or pain, interest or boredom—is represented in the mind as information.” [^93] By carrying around a constantly connected device in our pocket and by filling the spaces around us with ever-renewing and engaging technological media that gives us more information and others an access to our attention, we are–indirectly and inadvertently–sabotaging our capacity to freely invest our psychic energy and experience true enjoyment. As Csíkszentmihályi states: “If we are able to control \[the incoming flow of\] information, we can decide what our lives will be like.”[^94]

[^92] Isn’t it ironic when we don’t find anything interesting in our environment because we did not develop the skills to perceive the little signals, thus boredom actually increases? But let’s not go down that rabbit hole.
