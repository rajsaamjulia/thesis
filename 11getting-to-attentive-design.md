# Getting to attentive design

> Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.[^95]

One thing about design and technology that gives hope (and sometimes causes fear) is that being made by people, it can also be corrected by them (with certain caveats). Still, if the number of daily active users amounts to the billions,[^96] optimism requires a stretch of the imagination. If we recall Collingridge’s statement: “when change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult and time consuming” [^97], then the problems of the attention economy clearly fall in the latter category.

The struggle to organise and deliver information through design and the tension between private economic interests and humanist goals was already present during the 1960s for graphic designers and photographers, particularly in Britain. The First Things First Manifesto[^98], written by Ken Garland and signed by many others, articulated how “the greatest time and effort of those working in the advertising industry are wasted on \[...\] trivial purposes.” [^99] The suggestion addressed to their designer audience was to concentrate their effort and skills on “education and public service tasks that promoted the betterment of society” [^100] without asking for the unrealistic measure of totally abandoning consumer advertising. The designers neither accused their clients of bad intentions, nor the public of being gullible. Though the scale of information overload in 1964 was far from ours, the manifesto started the conversation about the power and responsibility of designing information and communication as attention became a scarcity.

In order to find a way out and forward into a future where we have better options than putting up with the psychological damage described above or cutting ourselves off from all digital information sources, the current digital media ecosystem needs corrections, revisions (and sometimes an overhaul) on all levels. Many designers work on some part of this arduous task; their tools range from small everyday interaction design decisions to full-time activism and research. I have tried to gather and organize a collection from books, articles, public talks and some interviews I conducted with designers with diverse career routes (freelancing, agency, large corporations), who are committed in one way or another to affecting change. While not all of them are necessarily involved with the question of attention, they all try to design ethically, considering long-term effects, and values expressed in qualitative goals next to financial earnings. A comprehensive report and a short profile about each designer is included in the appendix; the key points will be presented below in the relevant solution space.
